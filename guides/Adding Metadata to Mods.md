Add a file named `mod.json` in the root directory of your .zip file and edit it with any text editor. 
Paste this base structure in it and replace accordingly:
```
{
  "mod": {
    "name": "your_mod_name",
    "description": "your_mod_description",
    "author": "your_name",
    "version": "your_version_number",
  }
}
```
