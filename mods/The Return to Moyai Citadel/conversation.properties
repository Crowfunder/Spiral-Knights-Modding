t.af_chat_fiend_04=Donuts...
t.af_chat_fiend_03=All work and no play...
t.af_chat_fiend_02=And I was having such a nice nap.
t.af_chat_fiend_01=They took my stapler...
r.rc_warning_1a=I understand, I'll be sure to hear what Virgil has to say.
m.ritual_2b=Where did you find that?\! Hand it over\! I can finally complete my work\! But just a friendly warning\: I have no idea what might happen. It could be very bad. You probably want to be prepared in case things go... awry.
r.forge_knight_7b=I'll look at it later. (End conversation)
r.forge_knight_7a=Sure\! (Open the Forge)
n.hav_grem=Bootshuze
n.fc_bridge=Lost Soul
m.mission_collectorknight_d=Please, recover the battle sprites\!
m.mission_collectorknight_c=This place gives me the chills.
m.mission_collectorknight_b=They burst out of the ground all around us...
n.atg_greeter=Konway
m.rc_greet2_1a=Greetings, I'm Squad Leader Greta.  You must be {0}. Rhendon said we should be expecting you, and not a moment too soon.  This Rescue Camp is facing a crisis.
m.mission_collectorknight_a=It looks artificial, but it seems to have a sinister awareness...
n.monster_codex_royal_jelly=Monstrous Codex\:
m.af_chat_construct_03=Have you seen this boy?
n.winterfest_branch_exit=Recon Module
m.af_chat_construct_02=Does not compute.
m.af_chat_construct_01=I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.
m.ritual_1a=What dark ritual?
r.forge_knight_6a=Sounds great\!
r.rc_instruct_3b=Thanks for the information, I'll be off now.
r.rc_instruct_3a=I have another question.
s.af_chat_gremlin_01=Bright light\! Bright light\!
r.hav_guardian_1a=End conversation
m.seerus_1=Is it power you seek? The fury of a burning star bound in steel? I will show you both\!
m.hav_greeter_1a=Welcome to Haven, little one. Please join your friends in procuring shinies from the Clockworks. Shinies are always appreciated by the Strangers.
r.forge_knight_5a=How do Fire Crystals work?
m.och_leader_1_2a=Our advance has ground to a halt because of that artillery on the walls pinning us down.  Earlier, we staged a diversion to allow a small squad of knights to break through the front to silence that artillery...but they seem to have failed.  Now they're trapped in there, and we're stuck out here\! \n\nI need you to break through the front lines, get inside the artillery control center, and find a way to take out those cannons for good\!  Meanwhile, I'll get the troops reorganized so we can follow up your assault.  Good luck in there, soldier\!
r.first_conversation_1=Complete the mission.
m.core_resting_3=I hope those supplies come soon.
m.core_resting_2=Can't wait to get back to Haven...
r.mon_pocket_2=Thanks Nonna, but maybe next time.
m.core_resting_1=Don't worry. He'll pull through.
r.rc_instruct_2c=On second thought, I'm going to head out.
r.mon_pocket_1=Show me who is up for adoption\!
r.rc_instruct_2b=You said something about a "gate?"
r.rc_instruct_2a=The "Clockworks?"
r.impostoclaus_3b=End conversation
r.impostoclaus_3a=View Winterfest reward shop
n.geoknight=Geo Knight
m.casino_klepto_c=I'm not the Kleptolisk you're looking for.
m.casino_klepto_b=Hey, what's that over there?
m.casino_klepto_a=I won't steal anything... I promise\!
n.rc_technician=Technician
r.test_greeter_1=I shall do my best in this test\!
r.forge_knight_4a=Continue
m.och_leader_1_1a=Well met, {0}\! Glad to see Spiral HQ sent us some reinforcements, and not a moment too soon\! Our backs are against the wall and we need your help\!
m.npc_recruit_g=Have you seen a danger room yet? I hear they are really tough.
m.npc_recruit_f=Where is the safety on this thing?
m.npc_recruit_e=Have any pointers for me?
m.npc_recruit_d=This is my first expedition into the Clockworks\!
m.npc_recruit_c=I think I need to craft a better shield when I get back to Haven.
m.npc_recruit_b=Did I leave my calibur back at the Arsenal Station...?
m.npc_recruit_a=I just need to rest a bit before moving on.
r.rc_instruct_1b=No questions, just actions. I'm off now.
r.rc_instruct_1a=Questions? You bet I do\!
r.arc_mintut_6=Sounds great\! Thanks for the info\!
r.arc_mintut_5=Continue
r.impostoclaus_2a=Complete the 'Save Winterfest\!' mission and receive special Winterfest rewards? I'm on it\!
m.rc_bomb_1a=Had a chance to try out bombs yet? Unlike other weapon types, bombs can only be used as a charge attack. Doing anything else just causes it to fizzle out. But if you do charge them up... BOOM\! They can put a serious hurt on multiple monsters at once\!
r.arc_mintut_4=Continue
r.arc_mintut_3=Continue
r.arc_mintut_2=Continue
r.arc_mintut_1=I'm here to learn about the minerals found within the Clockworks.
r.tier_unequipped=Roger that, I'll head back for now.
m.final_test_knight_2a=I see.  This will be very interesting information for Spiral HQ.  Our base camp in Haven is just up ahead.  Head on up the elevator and meet the other Knights who survived the crash like yourself. The techs in the Lab will be eager to study that artifact.  They'll see to it once you get to Haven. \n\nDon't worry about the others in the Rescue Camp.  Thanks to you, we have a functioning elevator system to reach them.  You've saved them all\!
n.deskclerk=Desk Clerk
m.tut_intro4_1a=I'm going to stay here for now and locate any other Knights that have crashed in the area.  I'll meet you at the Rescue Camp to the north. \n\nAnd should you encounter anything really dangerous, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
s.af_chat_construct_01=Exterminate\! Exterminate\!
n.core_lead=Vaelyn
r.forge_knight_3a=Continue
m.monster_codex_snarbolax=Snarbolax \nThe mythical Snarbolax is immune to knight attacks. Ringing the Beast Bell when it is nearby will stun the beast into submission.
m.hav_entryknight_3a=You should get inside the town walls.  It's not safe out here.
r.impostoclaus_1a=Not on my watch. I will save Winterfest\! How can I help?
n.mon_pocket=Nonna
m.sl_guard_4=Good luck to you then.  Shadow Lairs will be the greatest challenge you will face yet.
m.sl_guard_3=All Shadow Lairs are locked with a strange mechanism that can only be unlocked with a 'Shadow Key.'  Shadow Keys can be purchased from the Supply Depot. \n\nOnce a party member uses a Shadow Key, the party is locked and cannot be changed, so choose your party members wisely\!
m.sl_guard_2=Recon Knights who have ventured within these strange, new worlds claim to feel a dreadful darkness enveloping them at every turn.  There's something else happening here and we need our most elite knights to investigate.
m.final_test_knight_1a=Astounding\!  I would have never expected a new recruit to crawl out of that fiery wreckage alive\!  You must really be something else... \n\nThe name's Feron, Lieutenant of the Spiral Order.  We had believed this entire complex was derelict until the elevator leading to it suddenly surged to life.  Upon investigating the whole place soon went up in a blaze\! \n\nHow did you end up here?
m.sl_guard_1=Well met, knight.  Before you lies elevators leading to what Spiral HQ are calling 'Shadow Lairs.'  Shadow Lairs contain some of the most powerful monsters in the Clockworks, so be sure that you are fully Tier 3 equipped before going any further.
r.vise_seerus=Sure, Vise.  I'll see what I can do.
m.rc_recruit_f=They say you're going to travel down this elevator and into the chasm below. You're a heck of a lot braver than I am...
m.rc_recruit_e=I can feel the electricity in the air\!  Looks like we won't be making our final stand tonight after all\!
m.rc_recruit_d=Between the warmth of the fire and the safety of the defensive turrets, I think I'll sleep well tonight.
m.rc_recruit_c=Can you believe this?  This entire chasm is filled with a giant machine of some kind.  It seems to go down forever. \n\nI wonder if the entire planet is like this?
r.forge_knight_2a=Continue
m.rc_recruit_b=Not much equipment has been salvaged from the crash pods.  There's not even enough here for each able-bodied Knight.
m.rc_recruit_a=We may not have power, but the least I can do is get a fire going to provide a little light tonight.
m.hav_entryknight_2a=Always good to see another Spiral Knight\!
m.mission_researcher_c=Don't know how long before our forcefield gives out...
m.imposto_99=Glorp\! Help, I'm under attack
m.mission_researcher_b=We're cut off\!  Please help us defeat those lichens\!
m.mission_researcher_a=We were studying that meteorite when those lichens appeared\!
r.bazaar_tour_16b=Thanks Tylen, I'll be seeing you\!
r.bazaar_tour_16a=(Follow Tylen)
n.fc_greeter=Lost Soul
m.npc_mineraltech_c=Don't mind Hubert, he's been de-spiked.
m.npc_mineraltech_b=Hmm, certain combinations seem to attract different kinds of monsters.
m.npc_mineraltech_a=I'm a field researcher working under Chief Geo Knight Wegner.
n.rfc_dungeon_2a=I was imprisoned here over a thousand years ago for speaking out against my liege lord, sentenced to be here for a lifetime as my punishment.  When the fires overtook the citadel even in my passing I did not find freedom.  My soul is bound to these cursed stones.
r.ritual_4a=Sigh...
r.forge_knight_1a=What is the Forge?
m.winterfest_campknight_3a=Those Grinchlins are tricky and unpredictable. I'd recommend bringing a variety of gear just to be prepared for whatever they might throw at you.
m.vise_seerus=Hello there lad\!  \nTaking on ol' Seerus aye?  Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one.  \n\nHe and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering.  Should your mission prove successful, see if you can bring me back a little souvenir.  I'll make ya something nice for your troubles.
m.af_cheerio=Cheerio\!
m.fc_court_complete_1=Our focus with the Spirit Mother is strong now thanks to you\! Use the water that flows from the spirit wells to extinguish the shadow fire. The path ahead is is ridden with shadow fire and Vanaduke's minions and while we sprites can do little to aid you in battle, we can at least summon spirit wells in certain areas.
m.hav_entryknight_1a=Did you come from the chasm?  How?
m.hav_mecha_1a=I got a great deal on this broken mecha knight. If I can just figure out how to get it working properly I'll have myself a personal bodyguard for my expeditions into the Clockworks.
r.bazaar_tour_15c=No thanks, I'll explore on my own.
n.atg_guard=Keston
r.bazaar_tour_15b=I'd like to see the services again. (Follow Tylen)
r.bazaar_tour_15a=I'd like to see the shops. (Follow Tylen)
r.rc_rhendon_1a=End conversation
r.rc_sleepy_1a=End conversation
m.npc_teaser_knight=This last mission sure was a strange one. We were clearing the way to an elevator when we saw some odd structures off in the distance. We couldn't see any way to reach them though.  I guess we'll just have to keep an eye out for them in the future.  The Clockworks is ever-shifting after all.
n.rfc_dungeon_1a=I have lingered in halls even after all these long centuries, denied my eternal rest by my cursed lord. I feel his spirit clinging onto this shattered realm even now. He refuses to leave and thus dooms us all.
m.standby_knight_recruit_3=For the Spiral Order\!
m.standby_knight_recruit_2=I've got your back\!
r.ritual_3a=End Conversation
m.standby_knight_recruit_1=You have my sword\!
m.winterfest_campknight_2a=S-so...c-c-cold.
n.vise_seerus=Vise
m.lab_knight3_1a=We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately it's barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship.  We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home.
r.bazaar_tour_14a=Roger.
m.imposto_75=Glorp\! I'm being overwhelmed\!
m.energy_info_3c=Energy can only be obtained by purchase with a real money transaction or for trade via the Exchange. To purchase or trade for energy, simply open the Supply Depot and click the 'Get Energy' button.
m.energy_info_3b=Energy is used for all sorts of things\! It's the primary currency for buying goods from the Supply Depot, it allows you to purchase upgrades for yourself, revive yourself in the Clockworks when you run out of Sparks of Life, and it's required to form a guild. \n\nYou'll also find all sorts of devices in the world that are powered up by using energy. Just look for the blue energy symbol on the device.
m.rescue_knight_3=I've really been needing to stretch my legs.
m.energy_info_3a=Energy is a very special power that is constantly emanating from the core of this world. It is totally stable and will never be lost unless traded or spent. (You can see how much energy you have on the energy module in your arsenal.)
m.rescue_knight_2=Whew\! It was cramped in there.
m.rescue_knight_1=Thanks for releasing me, friend.
m.casino_monster_f=Shh, don't tell anyone I'm here.
m.dark_harvest_exp=Welcome to the Dark Harvest Festival\!  This annual celebration honors the undead with festive masks, delicious treats and dangerous tricks\!\n\nTo participate, explore the Clockworks and try to find the legendary 'Punkin King.'  This ghoulish gourd gives out candy to visitors.  You can exchange the candy to the traders here in the Haven Town Square for monster masks\!\n\nShould you prefer the direct approach, or just need a few more, our vendor will sell you candy as well.
m.casino_monster_e=Hey down in front\!
m.casino_monster_d=Can I borrow your weapon?
m.casino_monster_c=I don't think anyone will notice I'm missing.
m.casino_monster_b=Stop looking over my shoulder.
m.casino_monster_a=Hey, no cheating\!
r.ritual_2c=No thanks, I'll hang on to this book for now.
n.hunter=Armero
r.ritual_2b=I've got a really bad feeling about this, but ok...
m.almire_historian_3a=Well, we now know there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses. It must have been quite a sight to see. We assume the rest of the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere. It is possible that some of it might have survived...though given the anecdotal evidence we think it is unlikely at best.
m.winterfest_campknight_1a=It's a hazardous climb, {0}. Watch your footing and beware those Grinchlin traps\!
r.sprite_tut_4cc=That's it for now, thanks\!
r.final_test_knight_2a=Thank you, Lieutenant, I'll head on into Haven.
r.och_leader_2_2a=The gates are as good as opened, Lieutenant\!
r.bazaar_tour_13a=Where do I find accessory tickets?
m.energy_info_2a=Awesome\! I'll break it down for you in three easy lessons\: what it is, how it's used, and how you can get more.
m.af_chat_gremlin_03=Water... gun.
m.af_chat_gremlin_02=Bye Bye, Billy.
r.tut_intro_1a=Roger that, I'm on my way\!
m.af_chat_gremlin_01=Gizmoooo...
r.ritual_1b=I think I have something that might be of interest to you.
m.almire_historian_2a=From the tomes we have recovered, we've learned that Firestorm Citadel was once part of a much larger kingdom known as Almire thousands of years ago. Although it was bordered by other aggressive nations, Almire was renowned for the martial prowess of its many legions. These legions kept the kingdom safe for many years. Alas, they weren't enough.
r.ritual_1a=I'll just be going now...
r.final_test_knight_1a=(Tell Feron about the Rescue Camp, Razwog and the Artifact)
r.rc_bomb_1a=Sounds like a blast\! Maybe I'll buy some from the traveling merchant.
m.monster_codex_vanaduke=Lord Vanaduke \nLittle is known about the eternal Duke of the Almirian Empire. Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness.
r.och_leader_2_1a=What's next, Lieutenant?
r.bazaar_tour_12a=(Follow Tylen)
m.energy_info_1a=Do you know what the most important resource on Cradle is? ENERGY\! That's right my friend, something so special it's worth shouting about\! Want to know about this super important stuff? I happen to be an expert on the subject\!
r.arc_leader_5=End Conversation
m.imposto_50=Glorp\! If I had bones, they'd be broken\!
n.rescued_stranger=Keepoh
r.arc_leader_4=I understand my mission.

r.arc_leader_2=If we could somehow harness that power...
r.arc_leader_1=Sure sounds important, tell me how it all works.
e.af_chat_undead_01=Purr
m.npc_rummageknight_b=I can't talk right now.
m.npc_rummageknight_a=I know it was here somewhere...
m.almire_historian_1a=We've recovered what little remains from Owlite Keep concerning the Kingdom of Almire. Combined with the snippets we've gotten from the nature sprites within Firestorm Citadel itself, we are starting to get a clearer picture of Almire's history.
m.casino_skelly_c=I've never left...
m.casino_skelly_b=Try again...
m.casino_skelly_a=Soo... bright...
r.rescued_stranger_1a=End Conversation
r.sprite_tut_4aa=That's it for now, thanks\!
m.och_leader_3_3a=Aye, it appears I'm no longer fit for this fight.  It's up to you now, {0}. You alone possess the strength to face Seerus and bring him to justice.  Many knights have lost their lives here today.  Honor their spirits by finishing the job\!
t.npc_veteran=Veteran Knight
r.bazaar_tour_11a=I've got it.  Anything else?
r.rc_greet3_1a=End conversation
m.och_leader_3_2a=It was those blasted cloaking fiends\! They came from the shadows and staged an ambush.   When I get my hands on Seerus I'll... Argh\! \n\n(Feron slumps to one side, clearly more injured than he initially appeared) \n\nBlast, I'm having trouble gripping my sword...

m.rc_technician_b=This thing is useless without power.  How are we supposed to defend ourselves from those monsters?\!
m.rc_technician_a=According to these scans there should be some kind of power source in the depths below the camp, but it's being diverted somehow...
r.moorcroft_archives_4a=I'll find those black kats and recover the Ancient Pages\!
r.core_lead_5=End conversation
r.core_lead_4=But I thought there was no way inside it?
m.core_guard_2=Have you brought us supplies?
r.core_lead_3=You're saying it's what... alive?
m.core_guard_1=You should go speak with Vaelyn.
r.core_lead_2=You want to open it?
r.core_lead_1=What's the situation Lieutenant?
r.tut_intro2_1a=I'm here, what happened?
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_d=Good luck in there, we know you can do it\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_c=We've broken through their defenses.  Now they're cornered\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_b=Be careful confronting the Warmaster\!
n.monster_codex_battlepod=Monstrous Codex\:
m.mission_cogknight_camp3_a=We're in\!  This is it\!
t.npc_mineraltech=Bryel
m.impostoclaus_fail=Our mission to save Winterfest ends in defeat\! The grinchlins have won, we must retreat\!
m.rc_vet_3a=I won't be able to relax until we've linked up with Spiral HQ.
m.fc_court_5=May the Spirit Mother guide you.
m.fc_court_4=Then you are brave as well traveler. You can find my kinsfolk throughout the whole of this court. Be very careful though, for Vanaduke's terrible minions are guarding them. Many patrol the main drag, so watch your back as you move about.\n\nOnce you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. When six others are reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells.
m.fc_court_3=Without the power of the rest of the sprites, water will never flow through this realm. It requires a focus link with the Spirit Mother to bring even the smallest of drops of water into such an oppressive world. The master of this realm has seen to it that the flames surrounding him will always burn.
n.rc_vet_2=Veteran Knight
m.fc_court_2=I am a sprite, a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. But Vanaduke discovered and imprisoned us. I managed to escape, but the other sprites remain in his custody.\n\nNow none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself.
n.rc_vet_1=Spiral Warden
m.fc_court_1=You... you are not one of the lost. You must be strong to make it to this court. Please, you must help me\!
n.rc_warning=Cautious Knight
r.moorcroft_archives_3a=I'll help any way I can, Pembrooke.
m.casino_pitboss_e=The guy in Devil-IT wanted to upgrade our office to all glyph-usage, but I like wasting paper when I can.
m.npc_supply_teaser_knight=Sorry I don't have much time to talk. I have to get all these supplies down to our forward outposts. People tend to forget that without knights like us running supplies down into the Clockworks, our ability to scout out areas further afield would be severely limited.  What a thankless job, huh?
m.casino_pitboss_d=I just put in another bulk order for office supplies. We keep running out.
m.casino_royaljelly_d=Remember to tip your servers.
m.casino_pitboss_c=I worked my employees hard to get where I am today.
m.casino_royaljelly_c=Three lichens slide into a room...
m.casino_pitboss_b=I promoted myself to Senior Manager of Ghastly Implements of Destruction.
m.casino_royaljelly_b=Here's a jelly gem for ya...
m.lab_harness_1a=I'm Riley, Morlin's assistant.  I'm in the process of inventing a way to enhance our battle sprites even further.  Check back later once you've acquired a permanently-bonded sprite.
m.casino_pitboss_a=Productivity is up two percent since I started mandatory overtime.
n.winterfest_campknight=Camp Guard
m.casino_royaljelly_a=I just flew in from Moorcroft and boy are my royal cores drained.
m.rescue_door_sk_success=Great timing\! You're free and clear. Good luck\!
m.core_lead_5=I don't know how, but they would have found a way.  They must have... and now they're gone.
m.core_lead_4=I'm saying that we know this entire world isn't natural, and I for one don't believe that those hordes of miserable gremlins, no matter how industrious, could have built an entire world.  They had to have been aided by something far beyond their measure and perhaps whatever that is lies within the Core. \n\nThe same goes for the Alpha Squad.  They wouldn't just disappear, even within the furthest depths of the Clockworks.  They were our very best.  It was this Core that swallowed them.
m.rc_vet_2a=Always be on your guard. Who knows what other dangers await us on this world?
m.core_lead_3=Yes, Captain Ozlo himself has ordered that we hold out as long as possible and learn whatever we can.  If we ever leave this planet, it will be because of this Core.  \n\nI am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks.  You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine.
m.core_lead_2=We're attempting to find a means to activate the Core through the power of the minerals found within the Clockworks.  Those minerals are capable of transforming the Clockworks- we have seen this in the Haven Arcade.  It is our belief that we can use that power to activate the Core and... open it somehow.
m.core_lead_1=Hail.  I am Lieutenant Vaelyn, commanding officer of on-site Core research.  You are clearly amongst the strongest of the Spiral Knights to reach these infernal depths, but strength alone will get you no further.
m.mission_cogknight_prisoner_b=I'll sneak out after it's safe.  Thank you for rescuing me\!
m.rc_nervous_1a=I want to buy something with the crowns I've earned in the training grounds, but that merchant is totally giving me the creeps. What do you think it's hiding under those robes?\!
m.mission_cogknight_prisoner_a=Warmaster Seerus is crazy\!  I should escape to Emberlight.

m.deskclerk_1a=Welcome to Moorcroft Manor, where tired spirits come to rest their legs (if applicable). If you plan on staying the night, please remember we will perform a light turn to your room every ninety-nine years, a continental breakfast is served compliments of the house every full moon and you may never leave this place for ever and ever. Enjoy your stay\!
r.moorcroft_archives_1a=Thanks I'll be careful.
m.lab_knight5_1a={0}, have you seen these minerals in your travels yet?  They're fascinating\! You should ask Chief Geo Knight Wegner about them.  I hear he's the expert on minerals\!
r.och_leader_4_3a=Until next time, Lieutenant.

m.barracks_booster_2=Purchase a Krogmo Coin Booster from the Upgrades Merchant\!
m.barracks_booster_1=Want to earn even more Krogmo Coins with every match?
m.fc_court_reminder_1=Once you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. Once we are all reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells.\n\nPlease hurry\!

r.hav_clock_2d=On second thought, I've got some adventuring to do. Bye\!
r.hav_clock_2c=What lies at the core of the Clockworks?

m.npc_veteran_e=A bomb is great for dealing with a horde of monsters.
m.moorcroft_archives_5a=Smashing\! Good luck to you, {0}. You'll need it- black kats are an unlucky bunch...
m.tortodrone_haven_2=Tucked away inside a mysterious garden we found a strange portal that HQ is calling a Grim Gate. From what we were able to decode you will need a key of sorts to open it. Spiral HQ thinks the glyphs we spotted the Fiends carrying might have something to do with opening the gate.
m.npc_veteran_d=I have to keep these new recruits out of trouble.
m.tortodrone_haven_1=Spiral HQ has us investigating reports that pieces of fallen tortodrones and clusters of dark matter are appearing all over the Clockworks. Kora believes the Fiends are up to something. There is evidence they played a hand in the disappearance of the tortodrones.
m.npc_veteran_c=I always carry a blaster, never know when it might come in handy.
m.npc_veteran_b=Don't forget your shield, it will save your life\!
r.atg_greeter_2a=Thanks\! I'm off to explore now.
m.npc_veteran_a=I always carry a variety of gear... just in case.
r.hav_clock_1b=Nothing at this time, thanks.

n.tut_warden=Spiral Warden
r.impostoclaus=I believe in you, Impostoclaus\!

m.npc_lostknight_a=Thanks for "rescuing" me but I feel fine.
n.moorcroft_archives=Pembrooke
r.dark_harvest_exp=Sounds like fun\!  I'm off to find the Punkin King\!
n.rc_recruit=Recruit
m.sprite_tut_7b=You may only select one ultimate skill per sprite skill so choose wisely\! Also note that selecting ultimate skills will further change the appearance of your sprite. \n\nWith all these options, your max level sprite is sure to look  and behave differently from the rest\!
r.bazaar_tour_9a=Handy, I'll keep it in mind.  What else you got?
m.moorcroft_archives_4a=Then scour the Clockworks for those wretched kats and destroy them\! Even if they ate the books you will be able to recover the Ancient Pages. These pages can be given to Montague in exchange for rewards. Help us and we'll help you\! \n\nBlack kats can be found randomly when encountering spookats in Tier 2 and Tier 3 (Arcade Gates and Missions). There is also a daily Prestige Mission that likely leads to a black kat nest.
m.rc_instruct_3b=A "gate" is an entry point into the Clockworks. They take the form of the lifts you see before you. Each gate has a display monitor showing the gate's unique icon as well as a control panel that allows the user to enter the gate. This gate here will always take you to the same place, but other gates have shifting floors beneath them. In those, you never quite know what's next\!
m.rc_instruct_3a=The Clockworks are the massive complex of gears and machinery that lies just below the surface of this whole world. It's truly an incredible sight. It is a strange and dangerous world in which we have found ourselves. Tread carefully.
r.atg_greeter_1b=No thanks, I'll explore the place myself.
r.atg_greeter_1a=Sure, where should I start?
m.casino_yesman_e=Undercorp employees get a free mug with every visit.
m.casino_yesman_d=Everyjelly is a winner at the Golden Slime\!
m.casino_yesman_c=I'm sorry, you missed Happy Hour by a minute. Next time.
m.casino_yesman_b=Everyjelly is welcome at the Golden Slime\!
m.casino_yesman_a=Enjoy yourself\!
m.monster_codex_trojan=Trojan \nThese massive leviathans are invulnerable from the front. Hit the crystal on their back to bring them to their knees.
m.sprite_tut_6b=Once you've applied all your skill points and achieved a very high level with your sprite, you will begin to select your 'ultimate skills.' Ultimate skills are improved versions of your sprite skills. Each sprite skill has two options for an ultimate skill.
r.bazaar_tour_8a=Well, if you say so...
m.moorcroft_archives_3a=Black kats are the darkest souls of the former Kat Tribe. They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. \n\nThey were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives. \n\nPlease {0}, you must help us restore the Moorcroft Archives\!
m.mission_apocrea_warden=If you're going further, be on your guard. I smell a trap.
m.rc_instruct_2a=What would you like to know?
m.bazaar_tour_16b=Wonderful\!  I'm glad I could help you get your bearings. Good luck to you, {0}\!

m.mon_pocket_1=Greetings\! I'm Nonna with the Emberlight Adoption Agency\! \n\nWe at the Emberlight Adoption Agency collect baby monsters that have managed to become lost in the darkest depths of the Clockworks.  No longer having a home or any means of caring for themselves, we try to find these needy monsters a good home\! \n\nBy purchasing one of these adorable 'monster pockets' you can carry around a baby monster of your very own\! \n\nThe Emberlight Adoption Agency will visit Haven from time to time, and you never know what we will have to offer\!
m.test_greeter_1=You here for some testing?  Ok, make sure you read up on the latest info regarding what to test on the Test Server board in the official Spiral Knights forums.  Thank you, move along.
n.bazaar_tour=Tylen
m.sprite_tut_5b=And don't worry about applying skill points the 'wrong way,' since you will eventually gain enough skill points to max out all your skills\!
r.bazaar_tour_7a=Gremlins?\!
m.moorcroft_archives_2a=Oh {0}, it's horrible, just horrible\! \n\nA terrifying swarm of black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives\!
m.rc_instruct_1a=Greetings, recruit.  Always good to see another knight make it to the Rescue Camp.  I imagine you're looking to prepare for your journey to Haven.  A good place to start is the gate here into the Clockworks.  Simply approach the control panel at the north end of the lift and press the action button ([[?ACTION]]).\n\nAny questions?
m.tut_intro3_3c=Remember, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
m.tut_intro3_3b=Be careful\!
m.tut_intro3_3a=Good luck\!
m.hunter_4a=That's the spirit\! Give those monsters what for\!
r.winterfest_campknight_1a=End conversation.
m.bazaar_tour_15a=Well, that about covers the basics of the Bazaar.  It's a really fantastic place to find just about anything you need. \n\nDo you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?
n.test_greeter=Reginald
r.winterfest_branch_exit=Close module
n.biotech=Biotech
r.fc_court_4_accept=Free 6 Lost Sprites? I can do that\!
m.arc_mintut_6=Our geological research is ongoing, so there may yet be other fascinating uses for these strange and powerful minerals.
m.arc_mintut_5=Minerals are used to create sprite food in the Laboratory. Sprite food is very important to the development of your sprite, so grab those minerals when you see them\!
m.arc_mintut_4=Once you safely reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one\!
m.arc_mintut_3=You will find ore deposits in all levels of the Clockworks, and you must attack them in order to break them down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable.
m.arc_mintut_2=During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals\: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter.
m.arc_mintut_1=Hello. I'm Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark and head of geological studies within the Clockworks.
r.lab_biscotti_4d=Continue
r.hunter_4a=End conversation
r.lab_biscotti_4c=Where can I acquire these items?
r.lab_biscotti_4b=How does appetite increase?
r.bazaar_tour_6c=No thanks, I'll explore on my own.
r.lab_biscotti_4a=I have other questions.
r.tut_intro4_1a=I'll scout ahead then\! Be careful, Rhendon.
m.sprite_tut_4c=Harness upgrades are definitely worth the crowns. Superior versions of each harness reduce combat skill cooldowns\!
r.bazaar_tour_6b=I'd like to see the services. (Follow Tylen)
m.sprite_tut_4b=Skill points are gained regularly as a sprite levels up. They can be applied to skills within the battle sprite interface. \n\nWhen applying a skill point, you must choose an augment to increase, such as the cooldown rate or overall damage.
r.bazaar_tour_6a=I'd like to see the shops again. (Follow Tylen)
m.sprite_tut_4a=Your sprite will evolve as you level it up. At certain key levels your sprite will require an Evo Catalyst be fed to it in order to level up further. Once fed, your sprite will physically change its appearance\! \n\nIt will be interesting to see how these strange, new forms of battle sprites evolve in time.
m.moorcroft_archives_1a=Welcome to the Moorcroft Archives, traveler. Here you will find an illustrious collection of ancient grimoires from many forgotten worlds. It's quite the sight, I know\! \n\nYou're free to look around but please don't touch- some of these books are filled with incredible mystic power. You could hurt yourself\!
m.forge_knight_7a=Now that you know about the Forge, would you like to give it a look?
m.tut_intro3_2a=I've established a comlink with Knights that have formed a Rescue Camp up ahead.  If you head north, you should eventually reach it. \n\nI'm going to stay here for now and locate any other Knights that have crashed in the area.  I'll meet you at the Rescue Camp before sunset. \n\nAnd should you encounter anything really dangerous, press [[?DEFEND]] to use your shield\!
m.hunter_3a=Indeed\! Monster trophies will require a great deal of materials, so it is only reasonable that a group effort is required. \n\nLastly, some of the materials you will need can only be acquired by spending boss tokens with Brinks in the Haven Bazaar. They act as proof of your valor in defeating such fearsome creatures\!
m.bazaar_tour_14a=You can find accessory tickets inside lockboxes or at the Auction House if another Knight happens to be selling them.
m.npc_campknight_c=I can already feel the frost fading.
m.npc_campknight_b=Come get warm by the fire.
m.npc_campknight_a=Have a seat and rest a while.
m.mission_lab_bystander_c=We formed a barricade around the Artifact but it was overrun. I'm sorry...
m.mission_lab_bystander_b=Our guards were overwhelmed.  We never stood a chance.
m.mission_lab_bystander_a=They came out of nowhere...
e.af_chat_construct_02=Whirrr
e.af_chat_construct_01=Beep\!
r.lab_biscotti_3e=Nothing right now, thanks.
r.lab_biscotti_3d=Tell me about required items.
r.hunter_3a=Then the hunt begins.
r.lab_biscotti_3c=Tell me about favored items.
r.lab_biscotti_3b=Tell me about appetite.
m.sprite_tut_3d=Perks are unlocked at random. Some perks are much rarer than others and will require a sprite to level up very high to unlock them all. \n\nYou can even gain perks after reaching level 100\!
r.lab_biscotti_3a=How do I feed my battle sprite?
m.sprite_tut_3c=See Riley here in the Lab to purchase new harnesses. Once purchased, a harness is automatically added to your harness list in the battle sprite interface. \n\nAdditionally, any time you purchase a direct upgrade to a harness you own, it will be replaced by the superior harness.
m.sprite_tut_3b=Each battle sprite will learn three skills that you can use in combat. Skills are learned automatically at certain levels as the sprite levels up. \n\nCombat skills become stronger with skill points.
r.bazaar_tour_5a=Roger.
m.sprite_tut_3a=Feeding your sprite materials is the fastest way to level it up. Talk to Biscotti here in the Lab for more information on sprite feeding.
r.rc_vet_1a=End conversation
m.af_chat_beast_02=Do not want\!
r.lab_progress_end=End conversation
m.af_chat_beast_01=Oh how beastly\!
m.forge_knight_6a=Fire Crystals are somewhat unstable and there's a chance that the forging attempt will fail.  However, we've found that by adding more Fire Crystals you can increase the chance that the item will be forged successfully. \n\nOn top of that, the more Fire Crystals you add, the higher chance there is for special bonuses to be applied to the item\! \n
m.tut_intro3_1a={0}\! Am I glad to see you\!  This place is so alien, I'm happy to see a familiar face and not another hostile.
m.hunter_2a=Smashing\! Then perhaps you and your mates will be of service to this lodge. You see, the alchemy machine you see before you can craft magnificent monster trophies for your Guild Hall. \n\nThe alchemy machines uses materials and crowns from your Guild Treasury and deposits the results into the Guild Treasury as well.
m.bazaar_tour_13a=Here we have Bechamel the Accessorizor, who can add accessories to your gear so long as you have a ticket.  With accessories, you can make your gear really stand out in a crowd, I highly suggest giving it a try.  You'll soon become the apple of every one's eye\!
m.af_hungry=I could sure go for a snack\!
r.rc_virgil_4a=End conversation
m.hav_guardian_1a=Welcome to Haven, {0}, we've been expecting you.
r.hunter_2a=Ah, so it's a team effort?
m.sprite_tut_2d=Battle sprites gain perks at certain levels that you can equip within the battle sprite interface. Perks provide bonuses to your stats.
r.lab_biscotti_2a=I'll check back later, thanks.
m.sprite_tut_2c=All battle sprites wear a mechanical harness that aligns their skills to a damage type. Not all sprites can wear all harnesses though. For example, a drakon cannot output piercing damage. \n\nBy default, you have an iron harness that any sprite can equip. If you want to branch out as you likely do with your weapons and gear, you need to purchase new harnesses.
m.sprite_tut_2b=As a sprite levels up, they will learn new combat skills as well as gain skill points.
m.impostoclaus_win=Glorp\! Glorp\! Winterfest is saved and one thing is clear\: all hearts now sing with holiday cheer\!
r.bazaar_tour_4a=Recipes?  For weapons and gear?
n.emberlight_visitor=Pakrat
m.sprite_tut_2a=Battle sprites level up by acquiring heat, just like your weapons and gear. They can acquire heat in two ways\: absorbing it as you battle in the Clockworks and by consuming materials and synthesizing them into heat.
m.forge_knight_5a=Each item will require a specific type of Fire Crystal.  Fire Crystals can be obtained from the Supply Depot, earned by completing certain missions, and found in treasure blocks in the Clockworks\!
m.hunter_1a=Hello there my good Knight, I am Armero, great hunter of the wilds and curator of this prestigious lodge you see before you. \n\nOn the walls are some of the many trophies claimed from many courageous expeditions, where life and limb were put on the line in order to experience the pure, untamed thrill of the hunt. \n\nNow I say, do you have the same spark within you? The same taste for the open air, for danger?
m.bazaar_tour_12a=Just one last shop to visit and then we're done. I've saved the best for last.
r.guard_laboratory_1a=End conversation

m.mission_cogmaster_2=Trespassers within my Arsenal?  I'll see to it you go... quietly.

r.hunter_1a=I've seen my share of danger, and I like it.
r.lab_biscotti_1a=Battle sprites eat food?
r.bazaar_tour_3a=(Follow Tylen)
m.sprite_tut_1a=Greetings, {0}. I imagine you have some questions about battle sprites. How can I assist you?
m.please_wait=Please Wait
m.forge_knight_4a=When using the Forge, you will see a list of any items that are ready to level up. Selecting an item will show you how it can be enhanced.
m.mission_cogknight_battle_d=You did it\!  That explosion took out the cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_c=Get inside, use the elevator...blow up whatever is controlling those cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_b=We won't be able to move further into the base until you destroy those artillery cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_battle_a=Can't...go on...
m.bazaar_tour_11a=Brinks is the Token Trader, issuing certain items to Knights in exchange for tokens that can be collected within the Clockworks.  Tokens can be found in treasure blocks, issued as mission rewards or found when defeating special boss monsters.
m.monster_codex_zombie=Zombies \nShambling Zombies will rise from the dead if killed near a Grim Totem. Draw them away so you can give them eternal rest.
m.impostoclaus_2a=Such bravery, such pluck\! Yes, perhaps with some luck you stand a chance against the terrible fiends that mean to destroy Winterfest dreams. \n\nSo note the addition of a Winterfest mission, take up your sword and I will grant you rewards\!
r.rc_virgil_2a=Why is this walkway here then?
r.rc_nervous_1a=End conversation
m.rc_end_3c=Once you reach Haven I would advise you explore the town and familiarize yourself with all the sights and services the town has to offer. You will gain access to more powerful gear than we offer here as well and be surrounded with many more experienced knights. Be sure to ask them for assistance if you get lost.
m.rc_end_3b=While the path is dangerous, you will not be traveling very deep, so the monsters you encounter should be easy enough to handle. However, scouts have been reporting increased gremlin activity in the area since we set up camp, so watch out.
m.rc_end_3a=No, you won't be able to return. Once you reach Haven your training is complete and your new objective will be to aid the Spiral Knights who are now based in Haven.
r.bazaar_tour_2a=Do Strangers sell anything else besides weapons and gear?
n.dark_harvest_exp=Muerty
m.biscotti_3=Thanks {0}, I appreciate it.  And do me a favour, please don't mention this little 'incident' to Spiral HQ...
n.rc_forge=Forge Knight

r.npc_teaser_knight=End conversation.
m.biscotti_2=Great\! There are two ways to help me out\: \n\nYou can accept the new Prestige Mission 'Total Caketastrophe,' which is available daily. \n\nOr you can journey into the Clockworks and weed out infestations of these 'Creep Cakes' as much as you like.  Just look for the tell-tale frosting\!
m.biscotti_1=Hi there, I'm Biscotti, Head Chef of the Skylark\!  We've got a little situation on our hands that may or may not involve sentient, monstrous cakes that may or may not have completely overtaken my kitchen and infested the Clockworks... \n\nAnyway, I've worked it out with the Strangers to provide rewards for turning in slices of cake that prove you've helped eradicate these horrible monsters that may or may not exist.
m.bazaar_tour_10a=Let's go visit Brinks.
m.tier_1_requirements=Well met, {0}.  In order to proceed and explore deeper depths of the Clockworks you must first achieve Rank 4-2. \n\nReturn here once you have completed the requisite Rank Missions.
m.mission_survivorknight_c=The watcher of the Wildwoods...the horrible Snarbolax\!

r.fc_court_2=Those wells look dry...
m.impostoclaus_1a=Glorp\! Glorp\! Glorp\! Merry Winterfest\!\n\nThat special time of year is finally here, when a delicate blanket of wondrous white snow covers Haven and every Stranger, every snipe and every Knight fills their hearts with holiday cheer.\n\nBut to you I must tell, all is sadly not well. Lacking motive or reason, a group of shriveled-heart grinchlins have threatened this Winterfest season\!
r.fc_court_1=Who would I be helping?
m.lab_knight2_1a=Emanations from this world's core have had strange effects on our battle sprites.
r.rc_virgil_1a=Why is that?
m.winterfest_branch_exit=The path to Haven allows you to escape this perilous mountain and collect a haul of Grinchlin treasures along the way\! \n\nHowever, should you decide to pass on it now and continue up the mountain, even greater treasures await...
m.rc_end_2a=How can I help you?
r.bazaar_tour_1c=No thanks, I'll explore on my own.
m.tut_intro_1a=Welcome to Cradle, recruit\! Always happy to see a knight survive a drop in one piece. We have a Rescue Camp not far from your position.  I'll guide you there- but ready your sword, there are hostiles on the road ahead\!\n
r.bazaar_tour_1b=What services can I find here? (Follow Tylen)
r.bazaar_tour_1a=Sure, show me the shops. (Follow Tylen)
m.hav_grem_3c=Most of them will attack you on sight, but there are some; outcasts from the colony, that have taken refuge in the towns below the surface. Theirs is a hard life, hated by their own kind and no longer in a world they call home.
r.rc_greet2_4a=I'll do my best\!
m.hav_grem_3b=All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole of the Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the king is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king.
m.hav_grem_3a=Gremlins are a race of creatures who are incredibly adept at creating and dismantling all manners of machinery. They are at once a legion of brilliant artificers and a force of powerful destruction.

m.arc_leader_5=You have proven that you are combat ready and I have faith that you will serve the Spiral Order courageously. The gates into the Clockworks are just up ahead. \n\nGood luck to you\!
r.och_leader_1_2a=I won't let you down, Lieutenant.
m.arc_leader_4=That's the kind of spirit I like to see. It works like this\: you use the gates up ahead to explore the Clockworks and retrieve special minerals. Then you deposit those minerals back in to gates to change the Clockworks below, creating new, unexplored levels.\n\nWe believe the minerals are the key to opening a path to the Core, we just need to discover how to use them\!
m.arc_leader_3=That's exactly right\! The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition. There's only one problem- the Clockworks themselves seem to be built like some kind of crazy death trap.\n\nReaching the Core is not going to be easy...
m.fc_bridge_3=The choice is not yours.
m.arc_leader_2=After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings.\n\nWith the help of the Strangers, we were able to set up a small base of operations here in Haven. Once we got our systems online, we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude.
m.fc_bridge_2=Lord Vanaduke is the master of this broken realm. Once the king of Almire, Vanaduke now commands a terrible legion in the ashes of his former kingdom. You would do well to never cross his path.
m.rc_end_1a=This is it, recruit. This is the final gate that leads out of the Rescue Camp, through the chasm and into Haven. Once you pass through, you will never need to return here. You can buy everything found in the Rescue Camp and much more in Haven. \n\nAny questions?
m.arc_leader_1=Well met soldier, and good work on reaching our base camp here in Haven. I'm Lieutenant Feron. I have been assigned by Captain Ozlo to oversee our Clockworks mining operation.\n\nBefore you lies "the Arcade," a fascinating complex that serves as our link into the heart of the Clockworks. Since you're new here, I'll give you a quick run-down of what Spiral HQ has us doing here.
m.fc_bridge_1=Few make it across the bridge traveler. Perhaps you stand a chance of surviving, or perhaps... no, even the good sprites below will be swallowed by Vanaduke's flames. It is hopeless.
r.rc_greet2_3a=I'll meet up with Rhendon before I investigate the generator.
m.monster_codex_battlepod=Battlepod \nThese immobile automatons hide a small arsenal beneath their double plated armor. Each Battlepod has a unique combination of attacks and defenses sure to keep you guessing.

m.emberlight_visitor_4b=None know for sure. Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven probably the same, founded by non-gremlins. Not part of plan\!
m.npc_captainknight_g=Remember to help your squadmates\!
m.emberlight_visitor_4a=Emberlight founded by gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us\: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in eyes of Great Colony gremlins.
m.npc_captainknight_f=Take cover if you get overwhelmed\!
m.npc_captainknight_e=Use the environment to your advantage\!

m.monster_codex_devilites=Devilites \nDevilites are the workhorse of the underworld. If a Pit Boss catches an idle Devilite he may promote them to an angry Overtimer or a docile Yesman.
r.rc_greet2_1a=What's the problem, Greta?
r.emberlight_visitor_4a=One more question, Pakrat.
n.rc_injured=Injured Knight
m.emberlight_visitor_3a=Help you with something?
m.och_leader_2_2a=Those heavy cogs are in our way, and from intel reports, the only way to open them up is from inside two adjacent gatehouses.  I will not waste needless lives battering at the gatehouse from the front.  I'll need you to find a way around.  Flank the defenses, get inside the gatehouse, and open up the gates\!

r.lab_progress_cont=Continue
m.mission_cogknight_camp_f=Be careful in there\!
r.emberlight_visitor_3a=Tell me about Emberlight.
m.mission_cogknight_camp_e=Gremlins hide explosives in those bunkers, I bet throwing something inside will set them off\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_d=Careful, those Gremlins have lined the place with barbed wire.
m.mission_cogknight_camp_c=We need you to get inside and take out those cannons\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_b=One of our squads made it inside but got cut off, save them if you can\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp_a=Reinforcements from Spiral HQ at last\!
n.sl_guard=Spiral Warden
m.emberlight_visitor_2a=But I come to warn you\!  Crimson Order not stop with Roarmulus Project.  Crimson Order desperate to destroy all enemies. Tall ones, little ones, and outcasts.  All enemies to Crimson Order\!
m.och_leader_2_1a=Well done, {0}\!  That was quite a fireworks show\!  Thanks to you we've been able to clear that accursed landing zone and move our base of operations up to inner gates\!
m.monster_codex_royal_jelly=Royal Jelly \nThis massive gelatinous cube has a short fuse and loves to throw his weight around. When his royal tasters are absent a poisoned parfait would be a royal pain.
n.hav_mecha=Bosco

r.emberlight_visitor_2a=Thanks for the warning, Pakrat.
m.casino_imposto_a=Another Gel Core please. Shaken.
n.rc_nervous=Nervous Knight
m.lab_progress_9=Another strange device\! This one was clearly not made by the Almirians any more than the previous device was made by jellies. One thing we've noticed however\: this device is still active. On top of that, the energy signature is similar to the readings we took off the Artifact before it was stolen. This requires some further research I think.
m.lab_progress_8=This gremlin comes from the colony of Emberlight, deep within the Clockworks. They're a group of outcasts that have defied King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order. We're hoping we can make a treaty with them that will allow us to use their colony as a base of operations for our missions deeper underground.
r.fc_court_complete_1=This will greatly aid me, thank you.
m.emberlight_visitor_1a=Gremlins of Emberlight thank you for stopping this threat.
m.lab_progress_7=On very rare occasions I've found jellies that haven't attacked us on sight. I'm removing the barbs off this one now. They're kind of cute when they aren't trying to impale you\!
m.lab_progress_6=That jelly palace...what an odd place. Also, I wonder what that strange device you found inside the palace was? It didn't appear to be made by the likes of jellies.
m.lab_progress_5=It will take a little time to get all of our equipment fully working again.
m.lab_progress_4=We've doubled the amount of patrols around Haven in case there is another attack, but I have a feeling that those gremlins already got what they came for...
m.lab_progress_3=Thankfully the damage to the lab wasn't too extensive. The equipment for maintaining our battle sprites is intact at least.
n.fountain=Cort
m.lab_progress_2=Thank you for defeating the Snarbolax. Too many of our squires met an early end because of that beast. I can rest easier knowing that threat is now behind us. \n\nI look forward to hearing about your future exploits, Soldier\!
m.lab_progress_1=I'll bet these Beast Bells really came in handy huh, {0}?
n.rc_rhendon=Rhendon
m.core_tech_3=Fresh air?  Warmth?  These depths are not an environment that many of us can stand much longer, but the Lieutenant insists that we keep at it, that maybe the surge of power from the next gate will provide us with the answer that we need. \n\nYou certainly can't argue that our Lieutenant isn't committed.  I don't think I've ever seen her close her eyes let alone sleep.
m.core_tech_2=That's easy, keep gathering minerals within the Clockworks and powering those gates within the arcade.  We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core.  The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths.  We can only gather so much data from each gate as it launches.
m.core_tech_1=Welcome to the Core on-site research camp.  Got any news from the surface?
n.hav_greeter=Hailoh
m.mission_camefrombelow=Everyone's gone. It... It came from below.

r.emberlight_visitor_1a=Continue
n.tut_intro=Rescue Agent
m.tut_warden_3a=Nicely done, {0}\! It seems you know your way around the battlefield. \n\nCome on, let's head to the camp. Maybe you can help us figure out just what the heck is going on here.
m.mission_cogknight_wounded=. . .
m.casino_guard_c=Glorp glorp. Have fun.
m.lab_hahn_1a=(Hahn looks busy and does not seem to notice you)

m.casino_guard_a=Glorp\!  No trouble here.
t.npc_lostknight_a=Harmon
m.core_unconcious_1=. . .
m.tier_2_requirements=Well met, {0}.  In order to proceed and explore deeper depths of the Clockworks you must first achieve Rank 7-1. \n\nReturn here once you have completed the requisite Rank Missions.
r.rc_end_3b=Thank you for your help. When I am ready, I will enter the final gate.
m.npc_survivorknight_c=I didn't ask for this.
r.rc_end_3a=I have another question.
m.npc_survivorknight_b=They came from the darkness. There was no time to react.
n.arc_mintut=Wegner
m.npc_survivorknight_a=They... They got everyone except me. I just hid in the corner.
m.fountain_1=Greetings and welcome to Haven\!  If you head north, you'll reach the Arcade where you can get up to speed on the details of our mission.  If you head west, you'll reach the Bazaar, where the Strangers have a selection of gear and weapons for sale.  Be sure to check their stock daily, it changes\!
r.hav_grem_2d=Actually, I have to run. Maybe some other time...
r.hav_grem_2c=Are there any friendly gremlins within the Clockworks?
r.hav_grem_2b=Do the gremlins have a leader?
r.hav_grem_2a=What exactly are gremlins?
m.tut_warden_2a=You and me both. Now let's get- \n\nHold on, something's not right. Brace yourself, I think we've got company\!
n.och_leader_4=Feron

r.rc_end_2b=What sort of challenges await me in the final gate?
r.rc_injured=End conversation
r.rc_end_2a=Once I make it to Haven I really can't come back?
r.hav_grem_1b=Nothing at this time, thanks.
r.hav_grem_1a=Tell me what you know about the gremlins.
r.rc_soil_1a=End conversation
m.hav_clock_3c=Something of immense power, little one. There is an enormous energy signal coming from the center of the Clockworks, but that is all we know. No one has ever made it to the core. Or at least if anyone has, they have never returned.\n\nThe ones to ask would be the gremlins, for they have likely gone deeper into the Clockworks than any creature. But that might prove difficult as they are quite a disagreeable lot.
m.hav_clock_3b=There are different theories. Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsible. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force. Even with the means to do so, how did they "start?" Where did they find the power?
m.npc_campguard_e=Well met\!
m.hav_clock_3a=It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures.\n\nThis world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine... I find it quite sad.
m.npc_campguard_d=I'm here keeping watch.  You never know when monsters might attack.
m.npc_campguard_c=We're resting here for a while before we journey deeper into the Clockworks.
m.tut_warden_1a=Hail, knight. You must be {0}, Rhendon radioed us and said you were on your way. Come with us, the Rescue Camp is just ahead.

r.och_leader_3_3a=Roger that, Lieutenant.  I'll make the Warmaster pay.
m.rc_injured_d=With the power restored, I was able to mend my armor. Let's hope I don't run into too many of those monstrous rust buckets again\!
m.rc_injured_c=Thanks to you we will not have to face another night like the last...
m.monster_codex_roarmulus_twins=Roarmulus Twins \nThese giant gun puppies showcase impenetrable armor and high powered munitions. Their skin is so thick they are only vulnerable to fraternal firepower.
r.hav_mecha_1a=End conversation
m.rc_injured_b=One of those mechanical monsters got me.  The cursed thing's claws tore right through my armor\!
m.rc_injured_a=Last night terrible monsters attacked us in the darkness.  It was utter chaos. With no power for the turrets we couldn't defend ourselves. \n\nSo many brave Knights lost...
m.hav_clock_2a=I will share with you what I know, little one.
n.ritual=Konjuring Kat
m.npc_onwatch_c=Did you see something out there?
m.npc_onwatch_b=I know they will come back.
m.atg_greeter_2a=To the West, you will learn about useful items found in the Clockworks. To the North, you will learn about a variety of block types and doors. To the East, you will find an array of traps and hazards as well as a combat room to practice defense against training cubes.  Don't worry, we have taken precautions to make sure the cubes are perfectly harmless\!
m.npc_onwatch_a=I can't talk right now. I'm on watch.
r.gh_bechamel_statue=Make a statue.
m.rc_warning_1a=Up these stairs lies the gate to Haven. Be sure to talk to Virgil before you enter so you know what to expect.
r.och_leader_3_2a=Lieutenant it doesn't look like-

m.bazaar_tour_9a=Ok, back to business then. \n\nPunch can add Unique Variants, a kind of special bonus to your weapons and gear for a price. But his methods are, er... chaotic.  You never really know what you're going to get. \n\nVise is a little more precise.  He can unbind your weapons and gear for a price, allowing you to sell or gift the item again\!
m.npc_techknight_c=Just a few more tests...
m.atg_greeter_1a=Welcome to our advanced training hall. Here you will find useful survival tips to help you on your journey through the Clockworks. \n\nWould you like some directions?
m.npc_techknight_b=Good data is like a good pudding, you can never have too much of it.

n.rc_instruct=Kinter
m.bazaar_tour_8a=Take it easy {0}, not all gremlins are cut from the same cloth.  Some disagree with the ways of King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order.  In fact, somewhere down in the Clockworks I'm told there's an entire town full of gremlins who left the Great Colony.

m.npc_minerknight_a=You can only carry one mineral at a time so choose the biggest one.
m.bazaar_tour_7a=Punch and Vise are gremlin smiths that can change the properties of your weapons and gear.
m.och_leader_4_2a=With the Biotechs' help, I should be on the mend and fit for duty again in no time.  {0}, I can't stress enough how important this victory is for all Spiral Knights.  You've helped us deal a mighty blow to the Crimson Order by destroying their Grand Arsenal. \n\nThanks to you, gremlin forces will not have any more of these massive war machines for some time. And with our Technicians studying what is available in Seerus's personal quarters we may end up gaining valuable insights into gremlin technology or even the location of the rest of the Crimson Order\!
r.energy_info_1b=No thanks, I'm content not knowing about such an amazing thing.

m.mission_cogknight_ambushed=B-beware...they...they are everywhere...in the shadows...\!
m.bazaar_tour_5a=That's right, you can acquire recipes and materials in order to alchemize weapons and gear at alchemy stations.  Come on, I'll show you one.
m.em_greeter_1a=Welcome to Emberlight, sanctuary for outcast gremlins.

r.sprite_tut_3a=And how does my sprite evolve?
r.tut_intro3_1a=Glad to see you in one piece as well, Rhendon.  Where are the other survivors?
m.tut_intro2_2a=You just hit the surface of Cradle.  My escape pod crashed just north of your position.  We should meet up and find the nearest rally point. \n\nBe careful and ready your sword, there are hostile creatures everywhere\!
r.almire_historian_2a=What happened to the rest of the kingdom?
m.bazaar_tour_4a=Vatel here will sell you a selection of recipes as well as personal color changers and other items.
m.rc_virgil_4a=Hail, {0}.  When you restored power to the camp, this elevator powered on as well.  I imagine it will take you down deep into the chasm below and what you will find there is anyone's guess. \n\nIf your aim is to travel down into those depths, ensure that you are ready to face whatever is waiting for you.

m.rc_virgil_3a=It seems to lead to some kind of elevator, but with no power, the whole thing is just dead.
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_g=If only there were some way to open up those gates\!
m.lab_biscotti_5d=In most cases this is just a standard favored item, but when your sprite is ready to evolve, an Evo Catalyst will be required.
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_f=Sneak around and see if you can get inside that gatehouse\!
r.sprite_tut_1e=Nothing right now, thanks.
n.rc_greet2=Greta
m.lab_biscotti_5c=Favored items can be alchemized using this very alchemy machine you see before you. All it takes is two of any one material and some minerals from the Clockworks. Easy\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_e=We'll hold the line\!
r.sprite_tut_1d=What are sprite perks?
m.lab_biscotti_5b=A sprite's appetite will increase naturally over time, though slowly. To increase appetite quickly, take it for a run in the Clockworks. Absorbing heat from monsters is a great way to burn calories\!
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_d=We saw the Gremlins hiding mines out there, watch your step\!
r.sprite_tut_1c=What are sprite harnesses?
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_c=Hang in there\!
r.sprite_tut_1b=Tell me about sprite skills.
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_b=We wouldn't have made it past that artillery without your help\!
r.sprite_tut_1a=How do sprites level up and evolve?
m.mission_cogknight_camp2_a=We saw the explosions all the way from camp\! That was amazing\!
m.mission_lockedoutknight_c=Thanks for rescuing our team\!
m.mission_lockedoutknight_b=We were securing the elevator when the door shut behind us.
m.mission_lockedoutknight_a=Thanks for your help\!
m.winterfest_branch_cont=The path of danger takes you further up this perilous mountain. For now you will pass on the cache of Grinchlin treasures stored here for a chance at an even greater haul further up the mountain. \n\nBe warned\! Should you be overcome by the challenges ahead before reaching the next shelter, you will forfeit all treasures\!
m.bazaar_tour_2a=Strangers like Quillion here sell you weapons and armor.  Each one specializes in a particular kind of item, so talk to them and find out what they carry. They're not very chatty, but they always have a fresh stock of items every day\! \n\nJust be sure that you've reached the appropriate rank to equip an item\!
m.seerus_defeated=I would rather it all burn than give the Arsenal up to anyone else\!
m.af_pip_pip=Pip pip\!
r.lab_harness_1a=I'll check back later, thanks.
m.rc_virgil_2a=This walkway leads right out over a massive chasm.  Don't want you getting blown off into the oblivion below.
n.tut_intro4=Rhendon
m.lab_biscotti_4d=Required items will appear once your sprite is ready to level up. After your sprite has consumed enough heat, a 'required material' notice will appear above the feeding tray. This material MUST be fed to the sprite in order for it to advance further.
n.tut_intro3=Rhendon
m.lab_biscotti_4c=At any given time a sprite has a 'favored item', a special material that it enjoys eating the most. Feeding one of these to your sprite is a great treat and grants the sprite a lot of heat.
n.tut_intro2=Rhendon
m.lab_biscotti_4b=Sprites have a set appetite that limits the amount of materials they can eat at any one given time. When you feed a material to your sprite, its appetite will deplete. Once fully depleted, you will be unable to feed it.
r.tut_warden_3a=End conversation
m.lab_biscotti_4a=Feeding your battle sprite is easy\! Simply open up your battle sprite interface and select your sprite icon. From there you can select a material from your arsenal to drop into the feeding tray. \n\nOnce you've queued up a material for your sprite to synthesize, simply click 'feed to sprite' and bon appetite\!

m.af_chat_slime_01=A slime draws near\! Command?
r.atg_guard=Thanks\! I'll go see what's inside.
m.rc_virgil_1a=Be careful up ahead.
m.lab_biscotti_3a=Hi there, {0}\! As Head Chef of the Skylark I've been assigned to oversee the nutritional development of our new sprite companions. They seem to have really diversified themselves down there in the Clockworks. It will be interesting to see how they develop. \n\nDo you have any questions about feeding and caring for your sprite?
r.tut_warden_2a=End conversation
r.deskclerk_1a=Um... Thank you?
m.rc_greet2_4a=Please {0}, help us restore power to the Rescue Camp so that we can set up a defensive perimeter.  We cannot afford to lose any more recruits to the creatures of the night\!
m.first_conversation_1=Congratulations, accept your prize\!
m.ritual_4a=Well, that was unexpected. I'll get it right next time\!
m.guard_laboratory_1a=I'm sorry, {0}, you are not authorized to enter the lab yet.
m.lab_biscotti_2a=Indeed\! A battle sprite can synthesize matter into useable energy. This machine can take certain materials and alchemize them into extra special sprite food... that is, when it's finally calibrated.
r.tut_warden_1a=Great, I'm looking forward to a hot meal.
m.lab_knight1_1a=We salvaged what we could from the Skylark and cobbled together the rest with help from the Strangers.
m.rc_greet2_3a=Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp.  It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. \n\nWe need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface.  But you'll need to be ready- it's completely uncharted territory and teeming with monsters. \n\nRhendon said he wanted to meet up with you before you take on this mission.  Why don't you see him first?
t.npc_campguard=Camp Guardian
m.ritual_3a=Ok, here goes...\n\nKAT-TU... BLOOGATO... NEKO\!
m.imposto_death=Abort Mission\! I'm retreating back to Haven\! Glorp\!
m.lab_biscotti_1a=Hi there\! I'm Biscotti, Head Chef of the Skylark\! I'm still calibrating the battle sprite food alchemizer, so check back with me later.
m.fc_greeter_2=May your end be mercifully swift.
m.fc_greeter_1=Heed my warning traveler; this is a dangerous and terrible realm. You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice.\n\nLeave this place if you want to live.
m.rc_greet2_2a=In short, this camp has no power and the sun is setting soon. Last night all manners of horrible monsters came after us in the dark.  We couldn't see and had no power for our defensive turrets. \n\n...we lost a lot of recruits. \n\nWe need to channel power to the Rescue Camp so that we can set up a defensive perimeter before night falls\!
m.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_1={0}, it's good to see you. It appears like something serious happened inside the Fort.
r.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_1=What have you found?
m.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_2=That's just it {0}, nothing. The base went completely silent a brief while ago. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms. We've detected several elevators departing.
r.mission_crimson_chaos_recon_2=Thanks for the intel. I'll check it out.
m.rfc_court_1a=Greetings again, grass-touching one.
r.rfc_court_1a=Grass-touching?
m.rfc_court_2a=Yes, we moyai sprites are the rock, the rock, and the rock. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below.
r.rfc_court_2a=Speaking of 'below', how do I get there now?  This place is collapsing\!
m.rfc_court_3a=Sadly, even with our link to the Moaither the Moyai Mother, restored, we can only do so much to save this place. The other Moyai gods were not as kind to Moyaiduke's kingdom for breaking the taboo. Yet, even as one path closes another might open. It is the nature of this shifting world.  Good fortune, star-borne.
r.rfc_court_3a=(End conversation)
m.rfc_court_4a=Even though you have defeated Moyaiduke, it appears as though the taboo he brought down upon this kingdom still lingers. It requires all of our power to keep these raging moyais in check.
m.rfc_court_5a=We all sensed the moment you defeated Moyaiduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this\!
m.rfc_court_6a=Hold fast, traveler. You stand in the court of the Kingdom of Moai. Do you not hear the trumpets sound the return of our mighty legions? Are you not in awe of the prestigious heraldry of our great houses and statesmen?
r.rfc_court_6a=Sure, it seems very impressive.
r.rfc_court_6b=I don't see or hear any of those things.
m.rfc_court_7a=(You sense great pride coming from the fallen Moai, but he says no more and stares off into the distance towards a great shadow of a statue, that only he sees.)
m.rfc_court_7b=Skill issue.
r.rfc_court_8a=(End conversation)
