b.new_chapter=Having defeated the Snarbolax and recovered the Alpha Squad recon module, it's time to check in with Intel Agent Kora to get a report on the analysis of the module and information about certification in the Hall of Heroes.
r.anniversary_start_3=Though my training never included confectionery combat, I'm in\!
m.alchemy_beginners_10b=You'll be alchemizing amazing items in no time\!  In fact, here are a couple of recipes to get you started.
r.anniversary_start_2=You what?\!
m.alchemy_beginners_10a=No problem, from the top then...
r.anniversary_start_1=What's going on, Biscotti?
m.becoming_champion_4a=I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. \n\nThink about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor.  Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen.  An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.
m.anniversary_gremlin_1b=Out, out, oooout\! Too many cooks in the kitchen\! Too many cooks in the kitchen\!
o.pierce_of_cake=Learn about monsters that inflict piercing damage

m.becoming_champion=Becoming a Champion
m.eye_of_needle=Eye of the Needle
m.alchemy_mastery_3a=At 4 and 5 star level, gear offers the best protection you can find and weapons pack the biggest punch.  If you want to stay alive where you're heading, you need to start building an arsenal of 4 and 5 star gear. \n\nAnd remember- as items reach 5 star they typically can branch even more than before.  Your combat options are about to really open up.  Plan your arsenal with care.
r.target_acquired_4a=Roger that Kora.
r.mission_sprite_1_6a=They look like dragons from fairy tales.

b.p_r3_mat_1=Spiral HQ is always seeking to further understand the creatures inhabiting the Clockworks through the examination of materials.  If you have some materials to spare, you can further increase your prestige by donating materials to Spiral HQ.
b.creators_and_created=In order to be fully prepared for the challenges ahead, Chief Biotech Hahn is requesting you contact him before undertaking the new missions that you have available to you.

m.becoming_champion_3a=Then use them with honor and let them protect you from the fury of the countless foes you will soon face.  The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it.  I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong.
r.mission_sprite_3_12a=See you soon, Morlin.
r.heart_of_ice_4b=(End reading)
r.heart_of_ice_4a=Open attachment?
m.alchemy_mastery_2a=A good sword is, well, good and all, but how about a great sword? If you want weapons that will shake the heavens, then mastery level alchemy is what you need. \n\nOnce you craft an item into its 4 and 5 star incarnation, you unlock that item's true hidden potential.
r.target_acquired_3a=I'll be sure to get my hands on the appropriate gear for the job.
r.elemental_my_dear_3b=I think I've got it thanks for-
r.mission_sprite_1_5a=I'm on it\!
r.elemental_my_dear_3a=Once again you talked pretty fast, can you go over it-
m.p_r3_gate_beast=Nature of the Beast
n.arc_mintut=Wegner
m.becoming_champion_2a=I've heard Spiral HQ has lined up for you some missions befitting a true Champion.  But in order to become one, you'll need the right gear. \n\nI am entrusting you with the tools you will need to become such a Champion.  With these recipes, you can craft the highest caliber of gear of the Spiral Order.  With it you can finally wear the armor of the Azure Guardian, wield the might of the Leviathan Blade, and face anything in the protection of the Aegis.

b.from_below=A squad of Desna's Recon Rangers is trapped somewhere in the depths of the Clockworks by a mysterious force. Judging from the severity of the reports and panicked communications from the squad, Spiral HQ believes that only someone with your experience is capable of handling whatever deadly force has trapped them.
m.becoming_champion_1a=Well met {0}, it has been some time since I first met you having just arrived from the Rescue Camp.  You've come along way since then, rising to the rank of Defender Elite no less. \n\nYou are a gifted soldier, {0}.  I have no doubt you will soon be a Champion amongst the Spiral Knights and instrumental in our solving the great mystery that is the Core, restoring the Skylark and returning home.  You have proven that you have what it takes to face the legions of dark forces that lurk below the surface.
r.mission_sprite_3_10a=Give me the details.

r.heart_of_ice_2a=(Continue reading)
b.skies_under_cradle=The Clockworks are a fascinating underground complex that houses entire worlds within its colossal, iron geo-globes.  One of them that recon knights have discovered is known as the 'Aurora Isles,' a series of mysterious floating islands under a false sky. \n\nAs a newly ranked Apprentice, you now have clearance to explore the ruins within these islands and collect any useful materials you may discover.
b.p_r4_weap_2=Knights that are rescued from gremlin captivity are often left with nothing to show for it other than bad memories of being locked up in a cage and abused by their snarling captors.  Their weapons are always stolen and their gear often damaged by gremlin engineers to prevent any notion of surviving an escape attempt. \n\nIn order to get these knights back into their squad ready for battle, Spiral HQ needs other knights with access to ample resources to pitch in and provide them with the necessary weapons and gear.

b.rescues_and_recycling=A 'Deconstruction Zone' is a gremlin work site where gremlins seem to tear apart existing levels and use the components to build new levels. Their ability to rapidly engineer levels and machines is incredible, surpassed only by their hostility to anyone who crosses their path. \n\nRecon Knights have discovered that a squad may have observed their engineering marvels a little too closely as they are now being held captive in one of the deconstruction sites near depth 10.  It is unclear what the gremlins have in store for these knights or if they simply plan on letting them perish along with the rest of the level they are dismantling.

m.guardians_of_cradle_9a=Quite the scarab nest we've stirred up this time eh, {0}? Reminds me of the time we engaged the Morai siege fleets over Isora. That was quite an all or nothing gamble.

e.expansion_example_2=Expansion Mission Set 2
b.p_r7_gate_undead=The ruins of Owlite castles are dark and cursed places that are swarming with legions of undead spookats.  The worst of these, the seemingly invincible grimalkins, constantly lurk in the shadows, awaiting the moment your life-saving light is finally snuffed out. \n\nSome knights succumb to the darkness and become paralyzed with fear in these shadowy realms. The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within.

r.guardians_of_cradle_4a=It would be my honor, Captain.
b.weight_of_darkness=It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld.  While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us. \n\nThe undead on the other hand remain a mystery.  Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, though it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds.  Given how hostile these creatures can be, the only way to obtain useful data is through direct interactions, like combat. \n\nSpiral HQ is requesting that you collect combat data for the powerful fiend and undead monsters in Tier 3 of the Clockworks in order to better understand the nature of these creatures. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with shadow resistant gear with elemental and piercing damage weapons\!
m.sale_cost=ON SALE\! {0}
b.p_r7_kit_2=Some knights are part of special research teams that rarely get the chance to stay above ground for very long.  These knights often use the subtowns of the Clockworks as base camps.

A happy researcher is a productive researcher\!
m.guardians_of_cradle_5a=Very good, {0}. You will find a new set of missions for you under Operations. These new missions will be grouped according to their overall objective and can be tackled in parallel to each other. This should allow you maximum flexibility in order to respond to each new threat as they come up. Farewell, {0}, 'Guardian of Cradle'.
m.honor_duty=Honor and Duty
b.p_r6_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves\!

You're really moving up fast in the ranks. \n\nAnyway, I'm Bechamel, and I'm here to give you a tour of some of the Bazaar's more advanced services.

m.creators_and_created_5a=Right.  Spiral HQ has informed me you'll likely be facing hordes of gremlins and constructs on this next go around.  Keep in mind that in Tier 3, these monsters can inflict pure elemental damage.  Do be sure to gear up appropriately.

m.hall_of_heroes_4_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 5 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.creators_and_created_4a=We've had a few cases where knights have met non-hostile constructs that they swear behaved like true sentient creatures.  But that is very difficult to believe. Gremlins are brilliant, but brilliant at the kind of direct engineering that simply gets the job done and little else.  Brute force. \n\nArtificial life?  Well, that's something else entirely.

m.shadow_knows_4a=Perhaps Geo-Science has no place in this conversation?  You are correct, {0}. \n\nMoving on, shadow damage is produced by fiend and undead family monsters.  Additionally, fiend monsters tend to be weak to piercing damage and the undead to elemental damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?
m.hall_of_heroes_4_2a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more.  Few knights make it this far and can assemble an arsenal of such great power. \n\nNow then {0}, for your 5 Star Certification you must be currently equipped with a 5 star or greater armor, helmet, shield and weapon.

m.creators_and_created_3a=Not all, but most of them are believed to have been directly manufactured from gremlin design, yes.

r.pumping_up_7a=Continue
m.silent_legion_2a=I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind.  No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers.  Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place.

b.p_r3_kit=Some knights are part of special research teams that rarely get the chance to stay above ground for very long.  These knights often use the subtowns of the Clockworks as base camps.

r.pioneers_10a=So where do I start?
m.choose_your_sprite_10a=So, you have chosen the shadowy maskeraith, battle sprite of those who wish to lurk in the shadows and strike the enemy with sneak attacks? \n\nOnce you choose there is no going back\!
m.mission_sprite_3_12a=I admire your courage but if initial reports of this construct monster are accurate, you'll need some additional help. I'll prepare a selection of battle sprites to be ready for bonding to you, {0}. We'll talk again once I've made the proper preparations.
n.mission_sprite_2b=Morlin
n.toxic_plant_2a=Secret Memo
n.mission_sprite_2a=Rhendon
m.guardians_of_cradle_1a=Hail, Vanguard {0}. Kora said you had news of the Alpha Squad. Please, give us your report.

m.silent_legion_1a=Have they sent you for me?  To bring me back?  No, I am where I belong now. I no longer serve the Spiral Order and will remain here. \n\nLeave this place and never come back.  Leave me be.
m.elemental_my_dear_3a=Magic?  What?  No, I'm talking about a psychic energy manipulation here, try and stay with me.  In any case,  elemental damage is produced by construct and gremlin family monsters.  Additionally, construct monsters tend to be weak to elemental damage themselves and gremlins to shadow damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?
m.new_chapter_3a=Spiral HQ has authorized you to visit the Hall of Heroes and receive your 2 Star Certification. \n\nThe Hall of Heroes is a place where Knights rising in the ranks like yourself will visit to both learn about and acquire new recipes for gear as well as receive certification to go deeper into the Clockworks. \n\nYour first visit requires only that you wear all 2 Star gear, which you already have so it should be a piece of cake\!
m.shadow_knows_2a=Spiral HQ has informed me that you are ready to learn about monsters that inflict shadow damage correct?
o.alone_in_dark=Make contact with a lost soul of Almire in the soldier's graveyard

b.eye_of_needle=After compiling the data you collected from the Owlite keep and additional intel from Recon Knights, Intel Agent Kora has prepared a debriefing for you with regard to the mass of negative energy blocking access to the Core.
m.creators_and_created_1a=Hello {0}, it seems you had few problems with the oozing hordes and their like which can no doubt be chalked up to a good education on their behaviors prior to the mission.

b.shopping_again=Bechamel has already given you a tour of the Haven Bazaar that included where to acquire new weapons, armor and recipes.  Now it's time to pay him another visit and learn about some of the more advanced services the Bazaar offers. \n\nYou will pay a visit to Punch and Vise, Brinks and even visit Bechamel's own shop\!
m.new_threat_bystander_1c=I'm worried about the sprites\!
m.new_threat_bystander_1b=Careful in there.  Looks like they had a big one with them...

n.mission_sprite_1b=Morlin
n.mission_sprite_1a=Rhendon
b.breaking_in_recruits=After braving the depths of Firestorm Citadel, Spiral HQ believes you have earned a much deserved break. As a newly anointed Vanguard of the Spiral Knights, Lieutenant Feron believes you are the perfect candidate for training a group of raw recruits how to survive the dangers of this world. Your mission is to link up with the recruits on the surface of Cradle and help them survive their first tour of duty.
b.ending_in_fire=A strange energy anomaly has been been detected in the levels just above the Core.  Contact Intel Agent Kora for details.
r.creators_and_created_1a=That and a solid arsenal, yeah.

m.shopping_again=Let's Go Shopping Again\!
m.ending_in_fire=Ending in Fire
m.elemental_my_dear_2a=Excellent, then we're 'off to the races' as they say.  Elemental damage is generally caused by energy based attacks that are comprised of anything from photon-based laser fire to arcane energy manipulation.
m.new_chapter_2a=We can't say for sure just yet, but it would seem as though that however Cradle was formed, it included large pieces of other worlds around it.  If this is true then we've never seen anything like this before.
m.shadow_knows_1a={0}, I hear you have been promoted to Knight... er, well done, yes?
n.hall_of_heroes_heavy=Izola
m.pioneers_11a=Right, down to business.  We've located an Alpha Squad recon module in an area of the Clockworks known as the 'Gloaming Wildwoods.'  However, this particular zone is home to a horrible creature known as 'the Snarbolax.' \n\nThe Snarbolax has made fast work of Squires like yourself, but I know you can handle it, {0}. But you're going to need to prepare.  I've issued you a series of missions that will allow you to assemble a loadout fit for taking on this terrible beast and reclaiming that recon module\!

m.silent_legion=The Silent Legion
m.mission_sprite_3_10a=Your sarcasm has been noted. \n\nNow then, about those empty sprite transport crates; we have confirmed foul play.
b.time_to_crafty=Bosco would like you to alchemize a Hot Edge and Frost Gun for him to inspect. If it's good, he'll inform Spiral HQ that you've grasped the vital art of alchemy and even add a couple powerful Unique Variants to your new weapons.  What a generous guy\!
b.rise_or_fall=Infiltrating the Royal Jelly Palace and taking on the hordes of slimes that serve the great Royal Jelly is not going to be an easy task.  It is highly recommended you seek one of the 'Battle Arenas' within the Clockworks and determine if your equipment is up to the challenge of facing so many savage slimes. \n\nSpiral HQ has located one of these mysterious arenas that seems to be filled with all manner of gooey gladiators seeking a challenge.  Give them a good fight\!

m.elemental_my_dear_1a=Hello again, {0}.  Spiral HQ has informed me that you are ready to learn about monsters that inflict elemental damage correct?
m.new_chapter_1a=Congratulations on becoming a Soldier, {0}\!  I hear you really gave that Snarbolax a clobbering, well done\! \n\nWe've had an opportunity to analyze Euclid's recon module you discovered in the Snarbolax's lair.  Based on the recording, it seems that Euclid suspected something our Geo Knights discovered sometime after the crash- that the levels within the Clockworks are comprised of terrain from multiple alien worlds\!
m.the_gauntlet=The Gauntlet
o.rise_or_fall=Test your might with a slimy showdown in the Battle Arena
b.operation_crimson_hammer_3=Warmaster Seerus is the master of munitions of the gremlin's Crimson Order.  Thought to be the true mastermind behind the Roarmulus Twins and countless other gremlin weapons, he is the Crimson Order's creator and supplier for their diabolical engines of war. \n\nRecon Knights under the command of Lieutenant Feron recently discovered Seerus's 'Grand Arsenal,' his development center and storage facility for all his weaponry.  Now, Feron himself is leading several squads of knights directly into the Grand Arsenal, with the intention of weeding out Seerus and destroying his war machines. \n\nMet with heavy resistance, Feron's squads require reinforcements and Spiral HQ is sending you in to assist.

m.pioneers_10a=Rulen was very... logical.  I think he was very aware of the odds we have of reaching the Core and then doing something with it in order to restore the Skylark.  I think Rulen knew exactly what kind of mission he was undertaking when they made their first descent into the darkness of the Clockworks.

b.p_r9_min=Chief Geo Knight Wegner is always seeking to further his research on the mysterious minerals that are found in the Clockworks.

I suspect that Spiral HQ will be issuing you many more missions in the future that could only be taken on by someone of your ability. \n\nAnd finally, it is my pleasure to inform you that you will soon be awarded one of the greatest honors of the Spiral Knights, the rank of Vanguard.  I will see you in the Hall of Heroes.

m.honor_duty_2a=I've read your report of the Core, it's fascinating.  What an impossible structure and to think that the Alpha Squad might actually still be alive but... inside that thing is just incredible. \n\nI understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.

b.p_r7_gate_beast=Our Geo Knights risk their lives working in the wilds of the Clockworks.  While their findings are invaluable, they are often stationed in the very heart of wolver territory.

The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within.
r.darkest_depths_2a=What do you mean?
b.shadow_beast=Spiral HQ has detected a recon module left by the Alpha Squad somewhere within the Gloaming Wildwoods.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\nThe Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past. Because of this, Tech Knights have placed Beast Bells throughout the area. Striking them should stun any beasts caught within the sound wave they produce. \n\nBe advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes which we have not seen before stalking this forest.

m.dreams_and_nightmares_9a=The rest of us thought we weren't going to make it. But then...then the light surrounded us and we were safe. We've taken to calling it The Sleeper.

The journey will be a dangerous one and it is recommended that you have everything you need before departing. \n\nCompleting this mission will leave the Rescue Camp behind you.
m.best_of_beast_3a=Should you find yourself facing beast and slime monsters in Tier 3, be aware that they are capable of pure piercing damage.

r.alchemy_beginners_9a=Let's go over it all one more time.
m.best_of_beast_2a=Yes well, let's get started then. \n\nTier 3 is closest to the Core and much like how high level items respond to its power, so do monsters.  Many of them take on new forms and are considered at their most dangerous.  You must prepare before taking on each mission.

While the monsters that run these towns are friendly, often the amenities are not exactly well suited for knights. \n\nThese knights could always use supplies to make their stay a little more comfortable. A happy researcher is a productive researcher\!

m.dreams_and_nightmares_5b=Herex slipped away\! I lost sight of him as things went black. It felt like a thousand hands were pulling us away. As if something didn't want us to follow.

b.crossing_chasm_b=Having restored power to the Rescue Camp and established contact with Spiral HQ, it's time you attempted to cross the chasm north of the Rescue Camp and reach Haven where the rest of the Spiral Knights have taken refuge. \n\nIn order to cross the chasm you will need to take an elevator down into the Clockworks and find another to bring you up on the other side.

One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. \n\nIf this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components.  Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis.  It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R.
r.go_shopping_6b=I think I've got it Bechamel, thanks\!
r.go_shopping_6a=I'd like you to give me the tour once more.
m.search_continues_4a=I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, {0}, something terrible.  I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.

m.darkest_depths_5a=Then let's get started.  Now that you've stopped the immediate threat to Haven, Spiral HQ is hoping to pick up the trail of the Artifact. It won't be easy. Fortunately I've got some missions lined up for you that will be invaluable for your survival in the dark depths you are about to face. Good luck to you, {0}.
b.target_acquired=After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ now knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility.  Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven.  Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_3a=...and it will be unleashed. You\! I will make you its first victims.
b.reporting_duty=Lieutenant Feron is responsible for overseeing the Clockworks mining operation in the Haven Arcade.  Report to him and learn about the situation in Haven and Spiral HQ's mission to reach the Core of Cradle.
b.rotting_metropolis=It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. \n\nA modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result.  Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air.  A squad that was attempting to pass through the city has gone missing.  Given that the very air is toxic, it is urgent that an experienced team enter this city and rescue the squad.  There is little hope left for them otherwise.
b.the_flickering_flame=After your victory in Firestorm Citadel, the nature sprites of the great Spirit Mother finally began to make headway in battling the cursed flames engulfing the charred remains of Almire. A recent flare-up has impeded that progress, hinting at some lingering malevolent force that continues to fuel the fires. Contact Intel Agent Kora for details.

This mischievous phantom delights in playing tricks on his audience but is quick to reward them with delicious candies for their troubles. \n\nCelebrate the Dark Harvest Festival and help the Strangers by seeking out the Punkin King and paying tribute.  You're sure to collect some candy along the way, so visit the Haven Town Square and turn it in for prizes\!
m.hall_of_heroes_heavy_1a=Hello {0}, I'm Izola, a knight who utilizes gear fit for a squad guardian.  The recipes I have for you produce highly defensive armor and hard-hitting weapons. \n\nHeavy weapons require precise timing to use effectively and the gear tends to slow you down some.  But what you sacrifice in usability is returned in sheer power.  The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad can depend upon to stay alive and face even the fiercest of monsters.

m.search_continues_2a=The recon module you collected is very strange.  I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say.  Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it.  It's not a structure built to enter from the outside.  Rather, it seems just the opposite.

b.p_r7_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves\!
m.darkest_depths_1a={0}, you defeated the Roarmulus Twins and saved Haven\!  On behalf of the Strangers and all the Spiral Knights in Haven, thank you\!  I can see why you have been promoted to Defender, you are truly deserving of such an honor.

Your briefing should explain everything.

m.hall_of_heroes_gunner_1a=Howdy {0}, the name's Daxen. I'm a knight who specializes in gunslinging.  The recipes I have for you produce weapons and gear that focus on ranged combat... you know, shootin' stuff. \n\nHandguns allow you to hit your enemies from a safe distance, but don't offer you many options once they close in on ya.  You've got to think and shoot fast to be a good gunslinger.  The gear I specialize in will make you a dead shot, not a dead knight.

r.welcome_to_haven_1a=Strangers?
m.mission_sprite_1_8a=Yes.  It would seem as though we have much to learn of this place. \n\nRhendon's report noted that many of the sprites were missing from the site. He suggested foul play.

o.p_r7_gate_fiend=Free the captured Knights from a fiendish corporate prison\!
m.explosive_plot_3a=Our recent intel from Recon Knights suggest that gremlins are planning something big.  We believe they are developing some kind of weapon they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself.  Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace.
r.delved_too_deep_1a=It's a long story, Kora.
r.shopping_again_5a=Handy, I'll keep it in mind.  What else you got?
m.p_r6_gate_undead=Scared to Death
b.p_r6_min=Chief Geo Knight Wegner is always seeking to further his research on the mysterious minerals that are found in the Clockworks.

Because of this he's always in need of brave knights to delve into the Clockworks to procure more for samples for him.
m.p_r4_gate_gremlin=Hazardous Heist

m.hall_of_heroes_5_9a=Hi {0}\!  Look at you, wow\!  Hey, Vanguard or not you know where to go if you want to really stand out right?
b.p_r6_gate_slime=The best way to keep slimes at bay is with copious amounts of rock salt. Slimes just hate the stuff as touching it makes them dissolve.  It's not pretty. \n\nResearch teams stationed in lichenous lairs will often surround their entire camp with rock salt so that they don't end up some slime's dinner.  As you can imagine, they go through the stuff fast.  When they run low, a squad is called in to battle their way to the camp and deliver the life saving seasoning.

These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. \n\nIn the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that black kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them.\n\nThe residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of black kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them... \n\nFor this mission, intel has located a black kat nest beyond an area with electrifying resistance. Recover those Ancient Pages and return them to Moorcroft Manor\!
b.p_moorcroft2=Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed black kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. \n\nIn the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that black kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them.\n\nThe residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of black kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them... \n\nFor this mission, journey into a fiery furnace where intel has located a black kat nest.

m.pioneers_9a=Rulen was recruited as the technical genius that Captain Ozlo believed would be required for navigating the vast, mechanized world of the Clockworks.  His primary responsibilities included everything from disabling locks to repairing armor to wrecking sentient constructs.  He was additionally the lead on analyzing the Core once the squad reached it.
b.p_r9_kit_2=Some knights are part of special research teams that rarely get the chance to stay above ground for very long.  These knights often use the subtowns of the Clockworks as base camps.  While the monsters that run these towns are friendly, often the amenities are not exactly well suited for knights. \n\nThese knights could always use supplies to make their stay a little more comfortable. A happy researcher is a productive researcher\!
r.rc_buddyknight_4a=End conversation
m.mission_sprite_1_4a=Hey, it looks like one of the sprites has taken a liking to you\! Well, let's not let that extra power go to waste, I'll stay here and protect these sprites. You use your new friend to help clear the rest of the area of hostiles.
o.securing_camp=Find and talk to Rhendon to gain access to missions.
r.hall_of_heroes_shadow_1b=End conversation
n.great_escape=Sputterspark
r.hall_of_heroes_shadow_1a=Ok, let's see what you have to offer.  (Browse recipes)
m.hall_of_heroes_5_7a={0}, I thought you would be taller.
b.vicious_viscous=Spiral HQ would like you to investigate levels of the Clockworks where the most powerful slime and beast monsters reside.  By exploring these levels and transferring your combat data back to Spiral HQ, all knights would ultimately benefit from your dangerous experience. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with piercing resistant gear with piercing and shadow damage weapons\!
r.go_shopping_b_2a=Sure, let's head to the bazaar.
m.alone_in_dark_3a=Should you attempt to enter the citadel and manage to reach the throne room, please, end his suffering.  Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return to their loved ones. \n\nAnd one more thing- I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress.  Finding and freeing it may prove useful.
b.pioneers=After the crash of the Skylark, Captain Ozlo selected an elite squad of Spiral Knights to be the first to enter the Clockworks.  They were never seen again.  Contact Intel Agent Kora and learn how you will play a role in solving this mystery.
b.chilled_to_bone=By now you have no doubt run into strange, undead monsters known as 'spookats.'  Recon Knights have finally discovered what seems to be the source of these ghostly cat-like creatures. \n\nLarge concentrations of spookats have been sighted in what is believed to be the darkened remains of an owlite castle.  Dubbed the 'Candlestick Keep' this shadowy realm is only illuminated by a series of owlite candles.    \n\nProceed with caution while exploring outside the light of the candles.  Lurking in the dark are enormous spookats known as 'grimalkins.'  Grimalkins seem to withstand all weaponry and are to be avoided.  Your only defense is to stay in the light\! \n\nSpiral HQ has issued you this mission in order to collect more data on the origins of the spookats and the mystery behind the fall of the owlites.  Investigate the Candlestick Keep and report your findings\!
m.lab_royal_jelly=Laboratory
s.rank=Rank {0}-{1}
b.p_r3_gate_gremlin=Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry.  Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. \n\nGremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site.  These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded.  Once you draw the attention of one gremlin, expect the entire crew to come after you\!
m.p_moorcroft3_r9=Purr Terror
m.p_moorcroft3_r7=Purr Terror
n.pierce_of_cake=Hahn

r.collector_prisoner_2a=Can you make it back to Haven?
r.shopping_again_1a=Do I ever\!
m.p_r3_gate_slime=A Pinch of Salt
m.pioneers_8a=Parma was the youngest of the bunch, a very talented Recon, but with little combat experience.  She and I went to academy together and I can remember the day when the simulator technicians had thought their program was busted due to Parma's performance.  She actually apologized\! \n\nBut still, I'm worried about her.  From the reports that I've read, the Clockworks are unlike anything we've ever encountered.  I only hope that as she keeps them informed of what's ahead, that they will watch her back.
b.p_r3_gate_beast=Our Geo Knights risk their lives working in the wilds of the Clockworks.  While their findings are invaluable, they are often stationed in the very heart of wolver territory.  These wild beasts relentlessly stalk our Geo Knights, snatching them in the night when unguarded.  Sometimes, wolvers will form a pack and assault an entire research team.  It is during these times that a talented squad must be called in to save them.
r.rc_buddyknight_3a=End conversation
m.mission_sprite_1_3a=They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_6a=Serve with honor, Vanguard.
r.go_shopping_b_1a=Is everything okay, Tylen?
m.alone_in_dark_2a=Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now.  His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. \n\nHe has the citadel ready for battle at all times, believing that his kingdom is still under siege.  He doesn't even realize that what he is trying to protect was lost a thousand years ago.
b.time_enough_at_last=A knight named Edger has gone missing while exploring the Scarlet Fortress.  Given that this crumbling castle is swarming with spookats and jelly cubes, his squadmates fear for his safety and have asked a more experienced knight like yourself to investigate. \n\nLocate Edger within the fortress and bring him back to Haven\!
b.p_r9_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines\! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.
r.alchemy_mastery_4a=End conversation
m.crossing_chasm_b=Crossing the Chasm
o.p_r6_gate_slime=Deliver a shipment of rock salt to the research team stationed in the lichenous lair\!
r.collector_prisoner_1a=Yes, but can you tell me what happened?
m.pioneers_7a=Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch.  A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. \n\nGrantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another.  The guy was selfless.  I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight.

m.shopping_again_9a=Here we have... me\!  I'm the Accessorizor, adding accessories to your gear so long as you have a ticket.  With accessories, you can make your gear really stand out in a crowd, I highly suggest giving it a try.  You'll soon become the apple of every one's eye\!
m.hall_of_heroes_5_5a=Nice to finally meet you in person, {0}\!  Congratulations\!
a.special=Special {0}
m.alone_in_dark_1a=(You see the lost soul of Almire standing before you.  In his face you see a profound sadness.  Staring beyond you he begins to speak without introduction.) \n\nLord Vanaduke brought the fire from the mountains to our kingdom.  Everything burned.  His enemies.  Even his family. \n\nMy family was lost too.  I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance.  I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn.  I don't even remember how it ended.  I have no memory of my passing.

m.go_shopping_b_3a=Whew, well that was much faster with you lending a hand, {0}. Listen, if you ever need a guided tour around the bazaar, just come talk to me. I can tell you anything you need to know about the shops and services here. \n\nHave a look around\! I'm sure you'll find plenty of interesting items. Thanks again\!
m.pioneers_6a=It was for this reason that Ozlo selected him to take a small squad down into the unknown depths of the Clockworks.  After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai typhoon fire you could probably handle anything right? \n\nBut maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability.  We just don't know.
m.terminal_meltdown=Terminal Meltdown
m.mission_sprite_1_1a=Alright, {0}, let's get started. Looks like you and I get to go on a little sprite hunt, eh? \n\nI've aligned my tracker with the recon knight intel but something's not right. The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite. They may be in trouble, so let's hurry\!
m.pumping_up=Pumping Up
r.rc_buddyknight_1a=Sure, I'm game.
o.search_continues=Contact Lieutenant Vaelyn via comlink
m.shopping_again_8a=Just one last shop to visit and then we're done. I've saved the best for last.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_4a=Now then, greet those that have helped you become what you are today. When you are done, take the elevator back up to receive your commendation.
o.shopping_again=Follow Bechamel on a tour of the Bazaar's more advanced offerings
m.p_r7_gate_gremlin=Hazardous Heist
o.ending_in_fire=Contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink
r.alchemy_mastery_2a=Sounds impressive.
o.best_of_beast=Learn about the most powerful beast and slime monsters
m.securing_camp_b_7a=What the heck was that?  Where did that door come from? \n\nIt would seem that this mechanical world beneath our feet has it in for us, {0}. Better watch yourself\! \n\nAnyway, I think this area is secure, at least until night fall.  Let's head back to camp.
o.vicious_viscous=Prove your valor against a legion of powerful piercing monsters
b.alchemy_beginners=Alchemy is a craft mastered by the Spiral Knights that allows for the inherent powers of various materials to awaken and fuse with each other in order to form powerful, new items\!  The Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries. \n\nDiscover how it will become an important part of your survival on this alien world.
r.true_champion_3a=If there's a way, we'll find it.
o.chilled_to_bone=Investigate the shadowy remains of the Candlestick Keep
m.go_shopping_b_2a=It is now. I was just on my way to the bazaar to drop off some supplies when I was ambushed by these gremlins. I thought they were from Emberlight, a colony of gremlin outcasts, but it looks like I was mistaken. \n\nJust to be safe, would you mind helping me get these items to the bazaar?
b.p_r4_kit=Some knights are part of special research teams that rarely get the chance to stay above ground for very long.  These knights often use the subtowns of the Clockworks as base camps.  While the monsters that run these towns are friendly, often the amenities are not exactly well suited for knights. \n\nThese knights could always use supplies to make their stay a little more comfortable. A happy researcher is a productive researcher\!
b.spark_roar=An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout. Unlike other monsters, constructs don't seem capable of reproducing on their own, meaning that any time one is deconstructed, it's a permanent dent in their numbers. It will be a worthwhile task regardless of Crimson Order influence or not. \n\nSpiral HQ is requesting that you enter these levels, investigate the possible hideout, and eliminate the construct threat. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with elemental resistant gear with elemental and shadow damage weapons\!
b.monstrous_research_8=Having smashed the most terrifying zombies to dust, escaped the cold maws of grimalkins and stood victorious in battle against an army of trojans, you have no doubt collected samples from these encounters that would be of great use to Spiral HQ's research teams.
m.pioneers_5a=Euclid wasn't your typical knight.  By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard.  As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora.  A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads.
n.shopping_again_b=Bechamel
b.monstrous_research_7=Having fought the elite Darkfang Clan gremlins, evaded the crushing blows of lumbers and withstood the optic blasts of retrodes, you have no doubt collected samples from these encounters that would be of great use to Spiral HQ's research teams.
b.monstrous_research_6=Having faced the jaws of the most ferocious wolvers, avoided the spikes of fully evolved jelly cubes and even the vile regurgitations of virulisks, you have no doubt collected samples from these encounters that would be of great use to Spiral HQ's research teams.
b.monstrous_research_5=Biotech Hahn is attempting to further his research of fiend and undead family monsters and is requesting samples from your recent missions.  He has once again specifically requested that you be reminded of his 'best free lecture yet' when making your decision as to whether or not to comply.
b.monstrous_research_4=Biotech Hahn is attempting to further his research of construct and gremlin family monsters and is requesting samples from your recent missions.  He has once again specifically requested that you be reminded of his 'other very informative lecture' that was given to you 'free of charge for the second time' when making your decision as to whether or not to comply.
b.monstrous_research_3=Biotech Hahn is attempting to further his research of slime and beast family monsters and is requesting samples from your recent missions.  He has specifically requested that you be reminded of his 'very informative lecture' that was given to you 'free of charge' when making your decision as to whether or not to comply.
b.monstrous_research_2=By now you have likely collected some interesting materials in the first stratum of the Clockworks that would be useful to Spiral HQ.  Help advance their continued research of the mysteries of Cradle by donating materials.
m.shopping_again_7a=Brinks is the Token Trader, issuing certain items to Knights in exchange for tokens that can be collected within the Clockworks.  Tokens can be found in treasure blocks, issued as mission rewards or found when defeating special boss monsters.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_3a={0}, it is my great honor, in the company of all those who support you and whom you serve, to award you the high rank of Vanguard of the Spiral Knights.
r.eye_of_needle_6a=End conversation
b.first_contact_b=With the power restored to the Rescue Camp, you can now use your comlink to contact Spiral HQ and find out where they have located after the crash of the Skylark.  Once you have made contact with Spiral HQ you will hopefully find out what caused the crash and the nature of this alien world you now inhabit.
b.p_r4_mat_012=Spiral HQ is always seeking to further understand the creatures inhabiting the Clockworks through the examination of materials.  If you have some materials to spare, you can further increase your prestige by donating materials to Spiral HQ.
o.time_to_crafty=Alchemize a Hot Edge and Frost Gun and turn it in for inspection.
o.p_r9_gate_gremlin=Steal the gremlin schematics from the gremlin construction site\!
b.p_r4_gate_undead=The ruins of Owlite castles are dark and cursed places that are swarming with legions of undead spookats.  The worst of these, the seemingly invincible grimalkins, constantly lurk in the shadows, awaiting the moment your life-saving light is finally snuffed out. \n\nSome knights succumb to the darkness and become paralyzed with fear in these shadowy realms. The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within.
r.alchemy_mastery_1a=I could always use a good sword.
m.advanced_alchemy_3a=You'll figure it out as you go along, trust me.  Take this Brandish for example.  It has within it the potential to become three different types of elemental blades that deliver powerful status conditions, or even a shadowy sword of darkness\! \n\nYou just need to discover the recipes that require a brandish and get crafting to find out. Here, you can even keep this Brandish I've got.  Transmute it into something amazing.
o.p_r3_gate_beast=Rescue the Geo Knights from the clutches of wild beasts\!
o.p_r4_mat_012=Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research.
b.heart_of_matter=Lieutenant Vaelyn led the first squad into the Clockworks that attempted to located the Alpha Squad.  She is a talented squad leader thought to be on par with Euclid himself.  Vaelyn has never given up her search and is now attempting to put together an on-site Core research team in order to better understand the very place where the Alpha Squad's trail is thought to end.
m.securing_camp_b_6a=Something has happened\!  That door just popped up behind you like a trap\! \n\nDefend yourself, {0}\!
m.securing_camp=Should You Choose to Accept
r.true_champion_2a=I'm looking forward to lots more intel then, Kora.
m.go_shopping_b_1a=Whew, I'm glad you came along when you did. Those pesky gremlins were going to wreck everything\! The bazaar would have been ruined\!\n\nOh right, where are my manners? My name is Tylen, it's a pleasure to meet you, {0}.
m.pioneers_4a=We need you to discover what happened to them.  You'll start by seeking out known locations of their recon modules and collecting them for analysis.  I will be in charge of locating their general whereabouts and directing you toward them.  It's your job to go into the wild to retrieve them. \n\nAdditionally, I'll provide you with a quick background of each of the four members of the Alpha Squad\: Squad Leader Euclid, Squad Guardian Grantz, Squad Recon Parma, and Squad Technician Rulen.
m.shopping_again_6a=Let's go visit Brinks.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_2a=You stand within the Hall of Heroes, where the best of the Spiral Knights offer what they can to aspiring knights.  Knights like you yourself once were when you first emerged from your drop pod and found your way to Haven. \n\nAnd after so many successful missions, daring rescues and exemplary performance in battle, you now stand fit to join these heroes.
r.eye_of_needle_5a=Roger that.  So you've got some missions lined up for me?
b.hall_of_heroes_5=It is time you entered the Hall of Heroes once more.  Having been fully Star Certified and successfully completed so many missions that have ensured the survival of the Spiral Knights on Cradle, Spiral HQ is preparing you for the high rank of Vanguard.
b.hall_of_heroes_4=In order to venture deep enough to reach the Core you must visit the Hall of Heroes and speak to Lieutenant Barrus to receive your 5 Star Certification.
o.faith_armor=Navigate the trap-filled chamber and rescue the apprentice, Wilks
b.hall_of_heroes_3=In order to venture even deeper within the Clockworks you must visit the Hall of Heroes and speak to Lieutenant Barrus to receive your 4 Star Certification.
b.hall_of_heroes_2=In order to venture even deeper within the Clockworks you must once again visit the Hall of Heroes and speak to Lieutenant Barrus to receive your 3 Star Certification.
b.hall_of_heroes_1=The Hall of Heroes is where knights go to receive their Star Certification allowing them to access deeper depths of the Clockworks.  Each certification ensures a knight meets the star level required to deal with challenges in the upcoming missions. \n\nThe Hall of Heroes also allows knights the opportunity to speak to veteran knights and discover their loadouts, even offering the opportunity to purchase recipes for these loadouts. \n\nVisit the Hall of Heroes and receive your 2 Star Certification in order to obtain access to missions within deeper levels of the Clockworks.
m.advanced_alchemy_2a=Basically it comes down to 'branching.'  You see, most of the alchemy you have likely seen up to this point follows a linear evolution path.  It simply improves over time and each upgrade is better than the last. \n\nBut not all items are like that.  Many of them can become multiple, completely different types of items than their original\!
b.faith_armor=An apprentice named Wilks who had just arrived from a Rescue Camp has found himself in what Spiral HQ calls a 'Trap Chamber.'  These levels of most likely gremlin design seem to be specifically built to trap and ultimately eliminate those attempting to explore the Clockworks. \n\nWilks probably didn't know what he had got himself into until it was too late.  Now he's stuck somewhere in the chamber and needs your help. \n\nSome traps can be avoided and sometimes you may find that you just have to take the hit. In saving Wilks, you will no doubt learn the true value of strong armor.
b.learn_recipes=Learn Recipes
m.securing_camp_b_5a=Ok, practice a few bomb attacks and then head in there and destroy those monsters\!
r.crossing_chasm_b_7a=End conversation
b.p_r7_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines\! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.

m.p_fast_advancement=Fast Advancement
m.pioneers_3a=When our technicians finally got the Skylark's communications systems online, we could not establish a link with the Alpha Squad and they have never been heard from since. Their channel is completely dead. \n\nTheir dead line is what has us all scratching our heads.  Our comlinks are built to withstand all manners of extreme conditions, even explosions.  Heck, they survived the Skylark going down after all.  There's nothing I can think of that could kill the link completely.
m.shopping_again_5a=Ok, back to business then. \n\nPunch can add Unique Variants, a kind of special bonus to your weapons and gear for a price. But his methods are, er... chaotic.  You never really know what you're going to get. \n\nVise is a little more precise.  He can unbind your weapons and gear for a price, allowing you to sell or gift the item again\!
m.hall_of_heroes_5_1a=Well met, {0}. It is good to see you once more and under such auspicious terms.
r.eye_of_needle_4a=I take it the only way to the Core is through the Firestorm Citadel?
m.advanced_alchemy_1a=We meet again, {0}.  Spiral HQ has asked me to introduce you to some advanced alchemy.  Don't worry, this won't take long.  I've got an old mecha knight to work on anyway.
m.true_champion_4a=Yes, I suppose we just might.  Safe travels then, {0}.
m.unknown=???
n.securing_camp_b=Rhendon
m.p_r6_kit=Supply Delivery
m.securing_camp_b_4a=Bombs are special in that they have no standard attack.  A bomb can ONLY be used as a charge attack, so make sure to outmaneuver monsters while charging\!
r.crossing_chasm_b_6a=Continue
m.guardians_of_cradle_11a=What little we've recovered from the Core Terminal has every Geo Knight, Biotech, and Tech Knight absolutely stumped. We'll be analyzing these findings for quite some time.
b.in_cold_blood=Something has really riled up the chromalisks in the levels below the town of Emberlight.  Spiral HQ sent a squad in to investigate and they quickly fell off the radar. Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. \n\nBiotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core. Others believe it may be mating season.  Regardless of the reason, the squad needs saving before they meet their end to the likes of these lizards\!
m.pioneers_2a=It should, there're plenty of new recruits that chatter about them constantly. They're like heroes to some knights. \n\nThe Alpha Squad was an elite squad of knights that Ozlo personally selected to first enter the Clockworks in an effort to locate the source of the massive energy signal below.  Because all systems on the Skylark were offline for several weeks, radio communication was not possible.  Instead, they left a series of recon modules throughout their travels, sort of like a breadcrumb trail.
m.hall_of_heroes_5_12a=Vanguard, eh?  The Rangers are always looking for skilled knights like you, {0}.  After all this pomp is done, come see me if you want to laugh in the face of death and danger once more\!
m.shopping_again_4a=Take it easy {0}, not all gremlins are cut from the same cloth.  Some disagree with the ways of King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order.  In fact, somewhere down in the Clockworks I'm told there's an entire town full of gremlins who left the Great Colony.

m.securing_camp_b_3a=Once the charge aura has reached maximum charge, release the ATTACK button and unleash a devastating charge attack\!
r.crossing_chasm_b_5a=How do I use it?

m.pioneers_1a=Hello {0}, I hope you're doing well.  Something has come up that will require you to face your greatest challenge yet. \n\nI have an order from Spiral HQ that comes from Captain Ozlo himself.  You have been selected as one of the Knights to actively search for traces of the Alpha Squad.

m.first_contact_b_6a=From what I've heard, if anyone can do it, it's you, {0}\!  Good luck\!
b.work_idle_hands=Devilites are a type of fiend that seem to have a very rigid corporate structure that governs their every action.  Recon Knights have discovered a series of devilite 'offices' throughout the Clockworks, typically found in the remains of an alien city. \n\nAnalysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads. \n\nIt's time these devilites were issued pink slips and their fiendish projects cancelled.
m.rc_buddyknight_5a=It seemed like the world itself tried to trap you back there, what a close call\! \n\nKeep your wits about you when you go off exploring the Ancient Generator below.  If the surface of this world is crawling with monsters and rigged with traps, who knows what you'll find down there in the dark\!
m.true_champion_2a=Well, as far as I'm concerned this is only the beginning for you, {0}.  You are a true Champion of the Spiral Knights.  And since I haven't been reassigned, I suppose it's just the beginning for 'us' as well\!
m.time_to_crafty=Time to Get Crafty
m.securing_camp_b_2a=Great\!  Now a quick lesson on charge attacks. \n\nCharge attacks can be performed with any weapon by holding down the ATTACK button and waiting for the charge aura to reach maximum charge.  You can still move around while charging\!
m.eye_of_needle_5a=It would seem so.  And this place, it just radiates evil, it's almost indescribable.  It's even starting to affect the levels surrounding it- fires are breaking out everywhere. \n\nYou're one of the best we've got, {0} and if there's anyone that could lead a squad through the citadel it's you.  But even reaching it won't be easy.  We're going to need to take care of a few fires and gather a bit more intel before storming the gates.
b.p_heart_of_ice_r9=Warning\: This is a Dangerous Mission\! \n\nDesna and her Recon Rangers are an elite team tasked with recovering intel from some of the most dangerous levels of the Clockworks.  Joining them could lead to great rewards, but it is guaranteed to be a perilous journey\! \n\nSpiral HQ has detected a sudden climate shift emanating from deep within the Clockworks. Freak snowstorms and blizzards have begun surging through the depths seeming to originate from an inhospitable, fiendish city known as 'Amu-Sol.'  The Recon Rangers have been dispatched to infiltrate Amu-Sol and discover the source of these freezing storms.

m.hall_of_heroes_5_10a=Congratulations {0}.  The Geo Knights owe a great deal to your efforts.
m.shopping_again_2a=Who doesn't right?  Let's head over to Punch and Vise's workshop.
r.eye_of_needle_1a=What is it, Kora?
m.first_contact_b_5a=We discovered a town known as 'Haven' and have set up a base of operations there. The locals have provided us with food, shelter and power.  It's not Isora, but it's home for now. \n\nI've pinpointed your location.  Unfortunately you'll need to cross a massive chasm in order to reach Haven.  Perhaps now that your camp has power there is an elevator somewhere leading into the Clockworks.  You may just be able to reach us that way.
m.intro_rank=Rank Missions are the main campaign of Spiral Knights. Completing Rank Missions earns you rewards and allows you to achieve higher ranks as a Spiral Knight.
r.honor_duty_3a=Thank you, Lieutenant.
o.crossing_chasm=Cross the perilous chasm and connect with Spiral HQ in Haven
m.rc_buddyknight_4a=Accept my mission and let's get to work blowing some stuff up\!
m.true_champion_1a={0}\! Oh, {0} you made it\! Haha\! \n\nI am so happy you came out of there alive\!  I was worried sick about you\!
o.welcome_to_haven=Contact Intel Agent Kora via Comlink
o.p_r9_mat_5=Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research.
o.p_r9_mat_4=Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research.
o.p_r9_mat_3=Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research.
m.securing_camp_b_1a=There you are, {0}\!  I was beginning to think you wouldn't show up\! \n\nOk, let's get to work securing this place.  But first, you'll need to equip that Proto Bomb I gave you.  Head over to the Arsenal Station behind me and equip it.
o.p_legion_almire_r9=Recover an ancient Almirian codex
o.p_legion_almire_r7=Recover an ancient Almirian codex
o.p_legion_almire_r6=Recover an ancient Almirian codex
m.eye_of_needle_4a=It's all a bit too convenient.  But do gremlins really have this kind of power?  I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering. \n\nIn any case, this Almire, it's not a kingdom any longer.  All that remains is a great citadel that seems to be engulfed in never-ending flames that Spiral HQ has been calling the 'Firestorm Citadel.'  From what we can tell, the whole place is swarming with undead and built like a fortress.
b.abandoned_depot=The Knights stationed in the Rescue Camp have converted a derelict facility below the surface of Cradle into a training facility to help teach new recruits the basics of survival within the Clockworks.  Beware\! As part of the Clockworks it is likely to be inhabited by all manners of monsters.  Stay alert\!
o.p_legion_almire_r4=Recover an ancient Almirian codex
m.arsenal_knight_1a=You can use the Arsenal Station behind me to change your gear. Once you head down into the Clockworks you will only be able to swap out your equipped gear at an Arsenal Station like this one, so it's best to be prepared\!
n.breaking_in_recruits_3=Wargel
n.breaking_in_recruits_2=Kneepo
m.laboratory_visit_5a=A recon squad has managed to track down where many of these battle sprites have landed.  Rhendon has been sent ahead to scout out three of these sites and will meet up with you in the Clockworks. \n\nYou must secure our battle sprites before they fall into enemy hands\!

m.shopping_again_1a=Hi there {0}\!  Wow, you've made Soldier already?  You're really moving up fast in the ranks. \n\nAnyway, I'm here to give you a tour of some of the Bazaar's more advanced services. To start, do you want to learn how to even further power up that gear of yours?
m.dreams_and_nightmares=Dreams and Nightmares
m.first_contact_b_4a=Looks like I need to get you up to speed.  We've crashed on a planet known as 'Cradle.'  Cradle is a fascinating world in that the entire interior of the planet below its surface is an ever-changing mechanical complex known as the 'Clockworks.' \n\nThe Clockworks seems to have been built by 'gremlins,' a furry race of malevolent monsters that have not taken kindly to our presence.
r.honor_duty_2a=I hope her findings produce something meaningful.
m.rc_buddyknight_3a=Let's put it to good use right away. \n\nYou can accept Missions by clicking the 'Mission' button at the top of the screen and accept the mission I've given you.
o.strength_unity=Defend the Geo Knights from a monstrous assault
m.eye_of_needle_3a=Exactly\!  So what the heck is it doing in the Clockworks now?  It just doesn't make any sense. \n\nSo, if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive, mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why?
m.laboratory_visit_4a=When a battle sprite is issued to a knight, a 'bond' is written into the sprite's code to support the knight no matter the circumstances.  They will never leave your side\! \n\nUnfortunately, the cargo crates holding the Skylark's cache of battle sprites fell deep into the Clockworks after the crash.
m.first_contact_b_3a=Wow, it sounds like you've already had quite the adventure, {0}\!  Spiral HQ will most certainly be interested in that artifact you recovered.  It's remarkable that you were able to face off against a gremlin in the Clockworks and survive.
r.honor_duty_1a=It's been an honor to serve, Lieutenant.
m.rc_buddyknight_2a=Well then you'll need one of these\!  It's a Proto Bomb and it's good for making things go boom\! \n\nI had an extra one in my pod so consider it an advance reward for saving all our hides here.
t.tomorrow=TOMORROW
o.p_r9_min=Gather minerals for Chief Geo Knight Wegner's research.
r.new_threat_12a=Roger that, Kora.
b.p_r3_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves\!
o.p_r3_kit_2=Gather supplies for delivery to Knights stationed in Moorcroft Manor.
m.eye_of_needle_2a=That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered\!

m.p_legion_almire_r4=Legion of Almire
b.becoming_champion=Having heard of your many accomplishments and successful missions completed for Spiral HQ, Lieutenant Feron would like to speak with you.
b.crimson_chaos=Spiral HQ has been monitoring several known Crimson Order bases in hopes of intercepting one of their elusive high-ranking members. Recon knights assigned to watch one of those bases report that it has suddenly gone silent and have requested backup before investigating it further. Head down to their location and investigate the base for any signs of what has happened.

b.a_call_to_arms=A frantic emergency comlink message broadcasts across all channels.
r.new_threat_11a=Continue
m.eye_of_needle_1a={0}, I'm glad you called, I have something big here for you.
m.laboratory_visit_2a=Ah, that's right, you're a new recruit.  Most knights encounter their first sprite on the battlefield.  Chances are you've not had the opportunity to see one yet. \n\nAllow me to explain...
r.apocrea_1_5a=End conversation

o.honor_duty=Contact Lieutenant Feron via comlink
b.toy_soldiers=Recon Knights are reporting much greater numbers of mecha knights in the first stratum of the Clockworks and have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. \n\nMecha knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight.  Proceed with caution when seeking out the production center and then shut it down for good\!

o.toy_soldiers=Destroy the Mecha Knight factory's production center
b.p_r3_min=Chief Geo Knight Wegner is always seeking to further his research on the mysterious minerals that are found in the Clockworks.  The experiments he conducts on his available samples tend to result in their disintegration.  Because of this he's always in need of brave knights to delve into the Clockworks to procure more for samples for him.

b.p_fast_advancement=Use this Test Server exclusive mission to quickly power up your weapons and gear.  Each level of this mission is exactly the same, allowing you to change your equipped weapons and gear at each depth. \n\nOnly a few heat embers are needed to max out any item\! 'Return to Haven' before you reach the end so you can come back to this mission.
m.hall_of_heroes_2_3a=Congratulations {0}, you meet the necessary requirements and have received your 3 Star Certification.  Take the elevator behind me in order to complete your mission.
m.chasm_b_rhendon_2a=That devil\! \n\nThe whole place is coming down\! We need to find a way to put this fire out now\!
b.shocking_sentient_sentries=Recon Knights have uncovered a secret weapons facility that according to the intel we have available, could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order.  It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs who have no doubt been programmed to defend the facility at all costs. \n\nWhile it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash. \n\nIt is advised that you prepare yourself with elemental damage and shock resistant gear before deploying.
m.shocking_sentient_sentries=Shocking Sentient Sentries
o.reporting_duty=Report to Lieutenant Feron in the Haven Arcade
m.pumping_up_9b=Great, then I will go ahead and give you credit for this mission. \n\nRemember, if you would like to come back for more training, The Advanced Training Hall is located in Haven Town Square.  Take care out there, {0}.
m.pumping_up_9a=Okay then, let's start from the top.
r.another_trace_3a=You can count on me, Kora.
b.p_r3_gate_undead=The ruins of Owlite castles are dark and cursed places that are swarming with legions of undead spookats.  The worst of these, the seemingly invincible grimalkins, constantly lurk in the shadows, awaiting the moment your life-saving light is finally snuffed out. \n\nSome knights succumb to the darkness and become paralyzed with fear in these shadowy realms. The only thing that can save them are brave knights who have long lost their childhood fears of the dark and all the terrible creatures that lurk within.
r.apocrea_1_3a=Tell me about these traps.
b.whipping_mishandling=After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within.  Their findings have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins. \n\nThis research team is in desperate need of supplies in order to maintain working on-site.  It would be of great help to Spiral HQ's continued research to have a squad enter the city and deliver the necessary supplies.
m.heart_of_matter_4a=Sorry, yes of course.  Good luck to you, {0}.  Assemble the best squad you can and lead them well.  We're all counting on you.
o.p_r3_gate_fiend=Free the captured Knights from a fiendish corporate prison\!

o.p_halloween_r7=Seek an audience with the Punkin King.
o.p_halloween_r6=Seek an audience with the Punkin King.
m.heart_of_matter_3a=Thank you, {0}.  I hope you succeed.  As you know, we believe the Alpha Squad made it this far, but it is unclear what became of them... Euclid, Parma, Grantz.... Rulen. \n\n(Lieutenant Vaelyn seems to almost drift off)

r.ending_in_fire_1a=Thanks Kora, I plan on being the first to reach the Core\!
m.time_enough_at_last_5a=I'm saying that I have a lot of reading to do now.  The fight is over, that's all. \n\nPlease, head back to Haven and let everyone know things are ok.
m.hall_of_heroes_specialist_1a=Hi there {0}, I'm Zebulon, a knight who utilizes specialty gear that is suited for specific scenarios.  The recipes I have for you produce weapons that target specific monster families and gear that has mixed defense types. \n\nSometimes what you really need is a sword that smites the undead or armor that raises your slime smashing proficiency.  The gear I specialize in is often built for a specific task, but is also great to mix and match with other sets.  Experiment\!
b.darkest_forces=Hearing that your next missions will have you facing the likes of fiendish and undead monsters in the depths of Tier 3, Chief Biotech Hahn has requested you contact him before deploying for your latest missions.
m.pumping_up_7a=Lastly, we have the trap and hazard rooms. You can come here to see how you can sometimes affect traps and also learn about traps that deal different kinds of damage.
r.shadowplay_1a=This ends here, Herex\!
r.another_trace_1a=You're kidding me, right?
m.darkest_forces=Darkest Forces
r.pioneers_8a=Tell me about Squad Technician Rulen.
m.apocrea_1_4a=The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose.
r.apocrea_1_1a=What is this place and what are you talking about?
r.shadow_knows_6a=Thanks Hahn.  Tell those other Biotechs I appreciate it.
m.heart_of_matter_2a=As you know I am attempting to assemble a research team to work on-site in the Core terminal.  In order to successfully utilize it to restore the Skylark, it is imperative that we reach it and set up this research station. \n\nAll evidence seems to point towards you having the potential to finally reach the Core.  By breaking through the Firestorm Citadel and establishing a link to the Core, my team could set up the necessary supply lines and get to work immediately.  But we can't do that while that infernal citadel and its horrible ruler stand in our way.
r.occurance_at_owlite_keep_2a=Continue reading
n.shadowplay=Herex
o.prestigious_opportunity=Contact Intel Agent Kora and receive Prestige Mission authorization
m.time_enough_at_last_4a=Yes, it is isn't it?  I should not have come here alone.  I should have stayed with my squad. \n\n(Edger looks off into the distance) \n\nI don't even remember how it happened.... maybe I never will.  But it didn't hurt.
m.another_trace_4a=Good luck, {0}.  Be sure to thoroughly prepare before attempting this mission.
t.rewards=REWARDS
b.p_r4_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines\! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.
m.pumping_up_6a=On the east side we have a couple of combat practice rooms. These Training Cubes are mostly harmless and are perfect for experimenting with your weapons and shield techniques\!
n.ranger_leader=Desna
r.pioneers_7a=Tell me about Squad Recon Parma.
m.rise_or_fall=Rise or Fall
m.heart_of_ice_6a=Wow, this thing is a massive tower of everfrost.  I've only ever seen little handfuls of the stuff, nothing close to what we're seeing here. \n\nThe intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. \n\nIt would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks.  Had he finished the job, well, I don't even want to think about how many sweaters we would all be needing right now...
m.apocrea_1_3a=The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares\: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life. \n\nThough you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way.
t.missioncomplete=MISSION COMPLETE\!
r.shadow_knows_5a=Oh?  What's that?
m.hall_of_heroes_cobalt_1a=Well met, {0}.  I'm Jorin, a knight who has mastered the standard issue Spiral Knight gear.  The recipes I have for you produce very reliable weapons and gear. \n\nJust because your weapons don't output fancy special damage types or your armor defends from status conditions doesn't mean you can't shake it in the Clockworks.  The gear I specialize in is good for just about any situation.  It will keep you alive and packs a punch on almost any monster that comes your way.
m.heart_of_matter_1a=Hello {0}, I've been meaning to talk to you for some time, but it seems Spiral HQ is keeping you very busy.
r.occurance_at_owlite_keep_1a=Continue reading
r.breaking_in_recruits_k2a=Roger that Kora.
b.purchase=Purchase Expansion
d.supply_depot_explanation=The Supply Depot is full of items for sale. As you complete missions, more items will become available.
b.p_r7_gate_slime=The best way to keep slimes at bay is with copious amounts of rock salt. Slimes just hate the stuff as touching it makes them dissolve.  It's not pretty. \n\nResearch teams stationed in lichenous lairs will often surround their entire camp with rock salt so that they don't end up some slime's dinner.  As you can imagine, they go through the stuff fast.  When they run low, a squad is called in to battle their way to the camp and deliver the life saving seasoning.
m.p_r4_gate_undead=Scared to Death
m.plan_of_attack=Plan of Attack
b.securing_camp=Before you attempt to investigate the monster-infested depths below the Rescue Camp, Rhendon would like to get you up to speed about taking on missions for Spiral HQ.
m.time_enough_at_last_3a=I don't know about that... I'm fine here amongst all these ancient tomes.  I've got plenty to read, more than I ever could in a lifetime.  But I suppose that won't be a problem. \n\nPlease, just head on back to Haven.  Let my squad know that I'm ok and that I'm safe.
m.another_trace_3a=The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate.  Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective. Be wary though, a Royal Jelly surrounds itself with plenty of protection.

m.another_trace_2a=The place is as strange as it sounds.  Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes.  These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures.

The recipes I have for you are pretty straightforward- producing weapons and gear that focus on blowing up your enemies to smithereens\! \n\nUsing bombs isn't a fire and forget kind of affair though.  Bombs require an understanding of timing, both before and after you drop one, in order to get the most bang for your buck.  The gear I specialize in will make you a knight that your squad sends in to take down many enemies at once.  Bombs are great for clearing out a mob of beasties in one swift KA-BOOM\!
m.time_enough_at_last_1a=Oh hello there.  I suppose you're with Spiral HQ.
m.another_trace_1a=Hello {0}, I'm happy to report that my equipment is back up and running\! Now I have some good news and bad news for you.  The good news is\: I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature.

This could prove disastrous for any levels in close proximity should the slimes enter the boilers and cause an explosion. \n\nMoorcroft Manor serves as an invaluable connection point into Tier 2 and its departed residents have been the most gracious of hosts.  It is in Spiral HQ's best interest to send a squad in to deal with the smoldering slimes before they create a firestorm that seals off our access to Tier 2. \n\nIt is up to you to locate the oilers and remove them from the boilers\!

b.silent_legion=Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash.  As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies.  Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. \n\nArkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost.  As these expeditions began to appear self-destructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. \n\nArkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and not returned.  Not wanting to lose the last member of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious statuary at depth 26.

Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. \n\nWe don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing.  This is bad news.
m.legion_almire_3a=Now only death and smoke hang in the air, even from these great heights. And the fires; the unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal, the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares, I know that these fires shall soon take me as well. \n\nI will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life.  It is not his to take, to twist. This shall be my final order.  This shall be my Justice.

m.target_acquired_4a=There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory.  We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory.  Please attempt to recover it.  I hope that analysis proves that Euclid's squad made it out of there alive...

m.legion_almire_2a=An excerpt from the accounts of Lord Brandell, High Chancellor of Almire\: \n\nLike so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire.  Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom.  Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke.  Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless. \n\nMy position has afforded me much in my life.  I used to love the view that my tower offers. From these lofty heights I thought of myself as the first one to greet the spring season, the first to smell the life in the air as the flowers bloomed.

They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel.  This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core. \n\nReaching him will not be easy given his location.

m.ending_in_fire_1a=Hello {0}, and congratulations in rising to the rank of Champion.  Allow me to say that in my experience working with you that you are truly deserving of such a title.

m.p_r7_kit_2=Supply Delivery
m.legion_almire_1a=Nothing like a death-defying romp through a haunted necropolis to really get the blood pumping, eh Rangers? \n\nThe necropolis originates from Almire, fallen kingdom of some crazy lord something-something, population\: innumerable legions of Undead.  Apparently these less-than-living residents are guarding something that Spiral HQ would like to acquire. \n\nOur job is to recover a special book, a piece of a much larger collection of works that may give us more insight into the nature of this cursed kingdom.  So grab your helmets, and your best zombie-basher- I'm not expecting a warm reception. \n\nLet's ride, Rangers\!
m.mission_sprite_2_8a=Yes, it seems that these sprites have mastered the ability to focus their powers on skills that protect their knight. Given that and their appearance I've dubbed them 'seraphynx.'
m.choose_your_sprite_6a=The maskeraith is a battle sprite that embodies deception and debilitation. Its skills focus on subterfuge\: caustic quills fire poisonous quills that explode when followed with an attack, shadow cloak allows a knight to become invisible to monsters, and hexing haze allows the knight to inflict monsters with a timed damage blast. \n\nThe maskeraith is best suited for knights who wish to lurk in the shadows and strike the enemy with sneak attacks.
m.lab_new_threat=Laboratory
m.delved_too_deep_3a=Amazing that after all this time we didn't know the truth. I mean, we've suspected for a while now that this planet was some kind of prison but who could have guessed that this 'Swarm' was just waiting for someone to stumble across the Core and free it?

m.target_acquired_2a=Yes, Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.'  Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade\! \n\nBased on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the Strangers should it reach the Arcade.

m.choose_your_sprite_5a=The seraphynx is a battle sprite that embodies protection and restoration. Its skills focus on supporting knights in combat\: ray of light creates a steady beam of holy light, heart attack increases the chance of hearts dropping from monsters, and angelic aura creates a light shield that protects its knight and party members within. \n\nThe seraphynx is best suited for knights who wish to protect their party and provide them aid.

I was tasked with baking cakes for the big Spiral Knights Anniversary Celebration and I may have got in a tiny bit over my head when I said I could bake a couple million of them in just a week. \n\nTo speed up the process I may have used a teensy weensy bit of pure, unrefined, dark matter instead of baking powder...

m.choose_your_sprite_4a=The drakon is a battle sprite that embodies fiery destruction.

m.alchemy_beginners_8a=Yes indeed\!  That's because every time you transmute an item through alchemy, there is a chance you can get one of several Unique Variants that makes your item much more powerful\!

m.welcome_to_haven_2a=The inhabitants native of Haven are called 'Strangers.' You can't miss them- they're the towering, cloaked figures with masks. Despite their intimidating appearance, they have been extremely helpful to us and mostly keep to themselves. The odd, little birds in town certainly seem to like them anyway\!
m.shocking_sentient_sentries_1a=The Sparkcaster Deluxe is almost stable, I promise. I need a little more time, Warmaster.
b.monstrous_research=By now you have likely collected a few material samples from your early expeditions into the Clockworks.  Spiral HQ is requesting some of those materials for their ongoing research of the creatures inhabiting the Clockworks.
n.true_champion=Kora
m.mission_sprite_2_4a=Uh, I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read\! \n\nAnyway, I'll stay here and protect these sprites. I see more empty transport crates; not good. You go on ahead and clear the area of hostiles so that a rescue squad can arrive safely.
n.welcome_to_haven_b=Kora
m.choose_your_sprite_2a=I will provide you with a summary of each battle sprite. In recognition of your valor in rescuing these sprites, Spiral HQ has authorized you to bond with one. This bond will last forever and is a significant responsibility. \n\nPlease think carefully before making your decision; there is no going back once you decide.
m.alchemy_beginners_6a=Many recipes require an equip-able, leveled item.  These are called 'special items' in a recipe and you are free to select the special item you wish, provided it's the correct item. \n\nThis is useful if the recipe calls for an item that you have two copies of, but one is superior.
m.new_threat_10a=Come in, {0}\!  What happened in there?
b.go_shopping=The Haven Bazaar is a place where all manners of item-related goods and services can be found.  Whether you're in the market for a more powerful sword or just want to make your armor stand out in a crowd, it's got what you need\!
m.welcome_to_haven_1a=You made it, {0}\!  I'm happy to see you arrive here in Haven safe and sound.  I'll confirm with Spiral HQ that you will now be undertaking missions in Haven.  To start, I've issued you a few missions that will help get you acclimated with all that Haven has to offer.  Be sure to say hello to the Strangers as you begin exploring.

t.energy_depot=ENERGY DEPOT
m.choose_your_sprite_1a=Greetings, {0}\! Now that I've had sufficient time to research the battle sprites you rescued I can give you a proper evaluation of each. \n\nDespite their well, strange appearance, we have concluded that these 'new' battle sprites are not only suitable for combat but may have even further enhanced capabilities as a result of their transformation.

o.pioneers=Contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink
b.p_r4_gate_fiend=A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.  Devilites are everywhere, and if they see one of their Pit Bosses nearby, they will do anything to look like they're being productive.  Unfortunately, productivity is often defined by attacking or imprisoning intruders, like a squad of knights passing through. \n\nIt is unclear what purpose imprisoned knights would ultimately serve in a devilite agenda. Those that have survived captivity have reported that conditions were poor, but the worst of it was the copious amounts of paperwork they had to fill out daily.  This is a fate no knight deserves\!
m.alchemy_beginners_4a=When you interact with an Alchemy Station you will open the alchemy interface where you can see your known recipe...
m.winterfest_danger_4a=Mount Grinchlin is an oppressive environment and few knights likely have the fortitude to reach its summit. If you feel things getting too rough, take the exit\! Otherwise you risk losing everything\!
n.chasm_b_rhendon=Rhendon
m.mission_sprite_2_1a=How about this place, huh? Looks like some kind of old rail station overrun with restless spirits. What an odd place to find underground. \n\nAnyway, we better head to the cache of sprites fast given what we found back in the Sunset Steppes. Let's go\!
b.uncomplete_mission=Uncomplete Mission
m.alchemy_beginners_3a=When you acquire a recipe and use it, it consumes the recipe, but logs it in your 'known' recipes forever\!  Once it's known, you can create as many items of that recipe as you wish, so long as you have the right materials.

m.p_r3_gate_construct=Assault on Machine Shop 13
m.p_r9_mat_345=Monstrous Research
b.sewer_stash=It seems that the Ironclaw Munitions Factory is not the only place gremlins are storing high-powered weaponry.  Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. \n\nOne of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems.  It's likely not going to be pretty reaching it, but eliminating the weapons stored in these wasteworks could result in far fewer casualties in the future.

m.winterfest_danger_3a=These shelters will offer you two choices\: exit the mountain and claim some Grinchlin treasure, or press on further up the mountain. \n\nShould you press on, you pass on the loot in that shelter, but will find even more treasures at the next shelter.
m.name=Name
m.go_shopping_7b=Wonderful\!  I'm glad I could help you get your bearings. Good luck to you, {0}\!

b.p_r6_weap_3=Knights that are rescued from gremlin captivity are often left with nothing to show for it other than bad memories of being locked up in a cage and abused by their snarling captors.  Their weapons are always stolen and their gear often damaged by gremlin engineers to prevent any notion of surviving an escape attempt. \n\nIn order to get these knights back into their squad ready for battle, Spiral HQ needs other knights with access to ample resources to pitch in and provide them with the necessary weapons and gear.

b.first_contact=You have escaped your crash pod and reached a Rescue Camp just as the sun set across the alien landscape.  Using your comlink, it is now time to establish contact with Spiral HQ.
m.winterfest_danger_2a=Mount Krampus is the home of the Grinchlin faction and their allies. They are a very stingy lot and won't drop any loot themselves. All their treasures are stored in the shelters you'll find up the mountain.
m.go_shopping_6a=Here we have an alchemy station that you'll no doubt become very familiar with as you upgrade your arsenal.  But no need to worry about that too much as Spiral HQ is likely to give you a mission later on that explains everything. \n\nWell, that about does it for your first tour.  Do you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?
b.p_apocrea_r9=Several capable knights have gone missing in a seemingly normal area of the Clockwork Tunnels. Spiral HQ suspects foul play and has assigned you to investigate the level.

b.choose_your_sprite=Morlin has prepared three of the battle sprites you rescued for you to evaluate. You have been authorized to choose one of these battle sprites and become bonded with it. This battle sprite will forever aid you in your future adventures, so choose wisely. \n\nThis mission cannot be repeated.
m.alchemy_beginners_1a=Hello there, {0}\!  My name is Bosco and I'm here to give you a rundown on the basics of alchemy. \n\nIt's pretty simple stuff really, thanks to these Alchemy Stations.  They do all the heavy lifting for ya\!

n.guardians_of_cradle_6=Wegner
b.return_of_ur=A Recon squad has reported that deep within a fiendish city, devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors.  Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion of Ur,' and are said to have once numbered in the thousands.  Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back. \n\nWhatever means the devilites intend to use to bring a few thousand trojans into the Clockworks, they must be stopped.  Infiltrate their city and stop the fiendish army before they become unstoppable\!

m.winterfest_danger_1a=Hail\! You must be the brave knight Spiral HQ has sent to deal with these Grinchlins. Mount Krampus is not like other levels so allow me to explain to you how it works.
b.the_collector=There have been scattered reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks.  Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and sprites it has taken captive.
m.go_shopping_5a=That's right, you can acquire recipes and materials in order to alchemize weapons and gear at alchemy stations.  Come on, I'll show you one.
o.return_of_ur=Stop the devilites from summoning an army of nightmarish trojan warriors
o.vile_engine=Locate and destroy the bizarre slime generators below the lichen colony
m.razwog_defeated=There is a strange crimson symbol on Razwog's clothing.
b.vile_engine=Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. \n\nSquads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23.  It is time a knight of your caliber form a squad to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. \n\nAny data that you could collect as to their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ.
m.itemlisting_sale=SALE
b.p_r6_gate_gremlin=Gremlin construction sites often contain valuable schematics of gremlin structures and even weaponry.  Once obtained by Spiral HQ, they provide rare insights into gremlin engineering. \n\nGremlin schematics are typically stored in terminals somewhere on site.  These terminals are locked down and heavily guarded.  Once you draw the attention of one gremlin, expect the entire crew to come after you\!

m.welcome_to_haven=Welcome to Haven\!
b.p_r3_gate_slime=The best way to keep slimes at bay is with copious amounts of rock salt. Slimes just hate the stuff as touching it makes them dissolve.  It's not pretty. \n\nResearch teams stationed in lichenous lairs will often surround their entire camp with rock salt so that they don't end up some slime's dinner.  As you can imagine, they go through the stuff fast.  When they run low, a squad is called in to battle their way to the camp and deliver the life saving seasoning.
o.p_r9_gate_fiend=Free the captured Knights from a fiendish corporate prison\!
n.prestigious_opportunity=Kora
b.pierce_of_cake=Now that you are undertaking missions in 'Tier 2' of the Clockworks, monsters will begin inflicting special damage types that you need to be aware of and prepare for or else you could face certain doom\! \n\nOne of our lead Biotechs, Hahn, has prepared a brief lesson on piercing monsters.

They're not very chatty, but they always have a fresh stock of items every day\! \n\nJust be sure that you've reached the appropriate rank to equip an item\!
b.sovereign_slime=The source of the strange energy signature is believed to be located somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace, the home to one of the members of the slime aristocracy, the Royal Jelly. \n\nThe might of these sovereign slimes is not to be underestimated.  Should you find yourself facing this hot-tempered highborn, you would be wise to be equipped with the appropriate gear and backed by a full squad of experienced knights. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with pierce resistant gear and shadow damage weapons before deploying for the Royal Jelly Palace\!

r.reporting_duty_1a=Sure sounds important, tell me how it all works.
b.the_gauntlet=One final battle stands in your way before reaching the Firestorm Citadel. Thought to be devised by Lord Vanaduke himself, this unrelenting gauntlet is teeming with all manners of dark creatures and culminates in a nightmarish battle arena that must be conquered in order to gain access to the gates of the Firestorm Citadel. \n\nThis mission will take everything you've got and requires a full arsenal of powerful weapons and gear.  If Lord Vanaduke is testing you, give him the fight that he's asking for and show him what a true Champion can do\!
m.go_shopping_1a=Welcome to the Haven Bazaar\!  It's a pleasure to meet you {0}, my name is Bechamel. Since I work here in the Bazaar, Spiral HQ has asked me to show new arrivals around this fabulous epicenter of commerce and let them know everything it has to offer. \n\nSo let's go on a quick tour shall we?

But it won't be an easy task. \n\nThose who accept this mission must climb Mount Krampus, a perilous trek filled with Grinchlin ambushes and icy deathtraps. Along the way you will find shelters that allow you to collect Grinchlin treasures and escape the mountain, or press on toward the summit for even greater rewards\! Just be warned\: Grinchlins and their allies are a stingy lot and will not drop ANY loot. All the treasures to be found on Mount Krampus are at the shelters. And should you pass on them for greater rewards ahead, you risk losing everything if you fail\! \n\nSome say that on the very summit of Mount Krampus lies a stash of Grinchlin loot that may contain treasures none have ever seen before...
m.crossing_chasm_b_7a=I'll take the artifact to the Lab.  When you're ready you should head into Haven and meet up with the rest of the crew.  I have a feeling we might be stuck on this planet for quite some time, so we might as well see what we can do to help.

m.hall_of_heroes_shadow_1a=Hello {0}, I am Sylvin, a knight who utilizes gear that offers high shadow damage defense.  The recipes I have for you produce armor and shields that protect you from the shadow attacks of fiends and the undead. \n\nShadow defense can be harnessed from the shadows themselves.  The armor and shields I specialize in are derived from the very fiendish and undead creatures that seek to use the power of the shadows against you.  Plus, it looks incredibly scary and cool.
m.crossing_chasm_b_6a=Bombs are special in that they have no standard attack.  A bomb can ONLY be used as a CHARGE ATTACK, so make sure to evade monsters while charging\! \n\nFeel free to give it a try.  Just remember to equip it at that arsenal station up ahead.

b.blades_fallen=Not every knight who enters the Clockworks returns to feel the sun on their face once more.  Within the perilous depths of the Clockworks, those that brave its dangers always face the reality that every expedition may be their last.  Sometimes their bodies can be recovered and other times all that is left is remnants of their gear. \n\nJust outside of Haven, Spiral HQ has built a soldier's graveyard where fallen knights can lay to rest.  As a Spiral Knight, you must face the reality of death in order to understand its gravity. \n\nDeliver the remains of an unknown knight, a sword, to a memorial within the graveyard.  But stay alert- dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses.
b.p_r6_gate_construct=Gremlins are not very good about cleaning up their messes.  Our Recon Knights will often stumble across what they believe to be decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines\! \n\nSpiral HQ has ordered that whenever possible, these factories and their war machines are to be shut down for good to avoid any future casualties.

m.toxic_plant_2a=An official order from Herex, the Whispering Venom\: \n\nProduction of Compound 42 is to cease immediately.  While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a...

Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance.

This is just a fancy way of saying that one of the craziest of the crazy gremlins likes to load his gun with unconventional bullets. \n\nWe don't know what he has cooking down there so arm yourself and don't forget to wear a mask.

With the sun setting fast, it's up to you to enter the dark depths below the camp and locate an Ancient Generator. \n\nIf you can restore power to the camp, the Spiral Knights can power their turrets and create a defensive perimeter. Once secure, it may be possible to reconnect with Spiral HQ.
m.reporting_duty_5a=Then I now authorize you to take on Arcade Missions.  You can access the Arcade via your Mission interface or approach the gates directly here in the Arcade itself. There is a massive world beneath your feet waiting to be explored.\n\nGood luck to you\!
b.great_escape=Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned.  It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. \n\nFurther data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built.  Spiral HQ however, has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out.

Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle.  This particular species of slime is formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.' \n\nLichen colonies can further combine to form larger and larger versions of themselves, rapidly evolving a range of deadly claws and barbs.  Prevent them from combining at all costs and save the research team\!

b.frostifur_fandango=Spiral HQ is receiving numerous reports of squads being wiped out by a pack of wolvers known as 'the Snowclaw Pack' near depth 10.  These ferocious frostifurs have an icy bite and are very territorial. Due to their relentless attacks, Spiral HQ is requesting an experienced squad infiltrate their den and destroy them to prevent any further casualties. \n\nIt is advised that you prepare yourself with piercing damage and freeze resistant gear before deploying.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_11a=But what about you and the others?
m.hall_of_heroes_0_1a=Well met, {0}. This is the Hall of Heroes, where veteran knights come to offer their services to members of our order who have attained the rank of Soldier or higher. \n\nBy undertaking more missions, I am confident that you will one day stand among us.

m.welcome_to_haven_b_2a=The inhabitants native of Haven are called 'Strangers.' You can't miss them- they're the towering, cloaked figures with masks. Despite their intimidating appearance, they have been extremely helpful to us and mostly keep to themselves. The odd, little birds in town certainly seem to like them anyway\!

b.p_r4_gate_slime=The best way to keep slimes at bay is with copious amounts of rock salt. Slimes just hate the stuff as touching it makes them dissolve.  It's not pretty. \n\nResearch teams stationed in lichenous lairs will often surround their entire camp with rock salt so that they don't end up some slime's dinner.  As you can imagine, they go through the stuff fast.  When they run low, a squad is called in to battle their way to the camp and deliver the life saving seasoning.
m.dreams_and_nightmares_10a=There isn't much time. I can't reach you from here and you need to make it out. Warn headquarters. Warn Haven\! If the Core isn't kept sealed The Swarm will escape and it will continue to consume everything and everyone.

Secure the sprites and clear the area of hostiles. You are authorized to utilize any sprites you secure in order to complete the mission.
m.welcome_to_haven_b_1a=You made it, {0}\!  I'm happy to see you arrive here in Haven safe and sound.  I'll confirm with Spiral HQ that you will now be undertaking missions in Haven. \n\nTo start, I've issued you a few missions that will help get you acclimated with all that Haven has to offer.  Be sure to say hello to the Strangers as you begin exploring.

m.the_flickering_flame_4a=That is our assumption as well. I hate to send you back into that horrible place, {0}, but if there is any hope of quickly getting to the bottom of this mystery it is you. The citadel is still very dangerous so please be careful\!

r.first_contact_1a=Sounds good Kora, what's next?
m.pierce_of_cake_3a=Yes, at this point you must begin forming an arsenal that protects you against special damage types. \n\nYour current missions will have you facing monsters with piercing damage attacks.  Thus, you must begin acquiring helmets, armor and shields that defend against piercing damage.

m.once_only=This mission can only be played once per day.
m.pierce_of_cake_2a=Very well {0}, let's get right to it.  It seems the closer monsters get to the Core, the more their unique properties begin to surface.  In most cases this takes the form of their being able to inflict special damage types that require special defenses in order to withstand properly. \n\nIn Tier 2, a monster inflicting a special damage type will always produce a split normal/special damage output.  Thus, normal defense is still a somewhat valid defense choice.
b.shadow_knows=Biotech Hahn has suggested that given your recent promotion, you are ready to learn about the nefarious monsters within the Clockworks that inflict shadow damage. Contact him via comlink and see what he has to say.
m.breaking_in_recruits_k2a=This is no longer routine training\! Get those Recruits to the elevator. We're extracting them back to Haven. You on the other hand need to head down and see who's at the bottom of this.
r.the_flickering_flame_3a=That gremlin Herex must be involved.

b.p_r6_kit=Some knights are part of special research teams that rarely get the chance to stay above ground for very long.  These knights often use the subtowns of the Clockworks as base camps.  While the monsters that run these towns are friendly, often the amenities are not exactly well suited for knights. \n\nThese knights could always use supplies to make their stay a little more comfortable. A happy researcher is a productive researcher\!

Any squad that has ever attempted to infiltrate the citadel has perished or was simply lost, like the countless lost souls bound to this terrible realm. \n\nLord Vanaduke is ready for war, believing in his twisted mind that any who dare enter the citadel to be an invading force bent on overtaking his kingdom.  He stands as the last obstacle before gaining access to the Core and the Spiral Knights having any chance of restoring the Skylark and returning home. \n\nAs a Champion of the Spiral Knights, you alone have what it takes to lead a team into the very heart of this inferno and face the titanic might of Lord Vanaduke.

n.occurance_at_owlite_keep=Moyai tome text\:
o.occurance_at_owlite_keep=Locate the ancient moyai tome.
b.occurance_at_owlite_keep=Upon defeating Herex you recover a golden relic holding a mysterious power. Alongside it, gremlin research notes with a location and few keywords. Spiral HQ sends you to investigate an unlikely lead that may give insight into the relic's nature, recover the ancient Moyai grimoire from the Candlestick Keep.
m.occurance_at_owlite_keep_1a=(This appears to be the tome describing numerous moyai legends.  Most of its pages are tattered and illegible, but one of the texts seems to be readable in its entirety)
m.occurance_at_owlite_keep_2a=In the very dawn of time, when the earth was yet to blossom with life, among the race of progenitors stood out two siblings, who could never communicate. The Unnamed, who could understand all things in the world, yet could not name them, and the Unknown, who could name all things in the world, yet could not understand them. 
m.occurance_at_owlite_keep_3a=Wandering the salted, untamed earth without being able to understand each other, one day, among the barren mountains of Almire, the two siblings encountered a unique stone that, while not overly big, was sizeable enough to approximate the dimensions of their heads. Fairly quickly, the Unnamed understood that its unique set of natural carvings bore a striking resemblance to their faces. Having recognized the shape as well, the Unknown named it with a word, that in the mother tongue of the progenitors meant as much as "Us".  "Moai" - exclaimed both siblings, as for the very first time, the known and the named converged into understood. 
m.occurance_at_owlite_keep_4a=From that moment on, with each sunrise the siblings connected nine meanings with nine names. Ecstatic with the breakthrough, they began to understand that "Moai" was much more than a mere word, but rather a profound idea, that would give birth to a legacy grander than themselves. Bearing that in mind, the siblings conjoined their knowledge and worked tirelessly, day and night, to purify the earth and tame it, so that it could give birth to the beings that would rule the Moai, define the Moai, serve the Moai and praise the Moai. As such were born the Pantheon of Eldritch, the Pantheon of Old, the Pantheon of New and the Moyai - the children of Moai who would soon swarm the earth and cultivate it, basking in the light of all pantheons.

m.new_threat_1a=Greetings, {0}\!  Congratulations on a successful mission. Deliver the tome to the lab and our technicians will analyze it,  just maybe we will learn something about the golden relic.
m.new_threat_2a=Right, there's new intel about the gremlin sect. It seems like it disappeared from the face of Cradle after you conquered the citadel. All bases we haven't attacked surrendered and went up in flames. Analysis suggests that they were trying to summon something using the relic and from that point on our sensors have been periodically going wild. Something is not right and we need to learn as much as we can about the relic to stop whatever is going on.
m.new_threat_3a=Once we find the source of disturbances you will be dispatched to deal with their cause. Whatever this power is, it's nothing like anything we've seen to date, it's not out of this world.
m.new_threat_4a=(Kora pauses) \n\nHold on, Rhendon is calling now; says it's urgent. Patching him through...
m.new_threat_7a=I told you, fool, our defeat was but momentarily. You cannot stop us now.
m.new_threat_8a=It was already too late when you found us in the citadel, the godlings have already descended onto this sinful earth, you will not be able to stop the judgement. This relic is merely but a key to finish what was already started.
m.new_threat_9a=I'll see you in hell, pagan fool. To the Factory of Gods, brothers!
r.new_threat_10a=There was an attack.  The Relic's been stolen\!
m.new_threat_11a=What? But we've dealt with the remains of the sect, how are they still up and running?
m.new_threat_12a=Chase after them! We are tracking them with our sensors, they are trying to hide somewhere in the Clockworks, we've not seen this facility before, be prepared for anything.

b.built_to_destroy=Herex stole the Golden Moyai relic and fled towards a previously unknown gremlin facility. Spiral HQ wants you to venture there and recover the relic to stop whatever scheme is unfolding there. What ungodly experiments could they be doing there?
m.built_to_destroy_2b= GLOSSARY\: \n\nFailed Godling - For the most part it's standard issue mechas imbued with Moyai artifacts bearing trace amounts of Moai energy. All done in (vain) attempt to summon minor godlings that would be at our disposition. As much as I adore this idea, for the most part the artifacts are not powerful enough or tainted, as such the created godlings become severely mutated and uncontrollable abominations.\n\n\n INDEX OF FAILED GODLINGS\: \n\nCrux - Calling them a complete failure is an understatement. Cruxes are the largest and the most varied category of failures sharing two common traits - mostly immobile and highly unstable. The residual Moai energy makes some of them highly explosive, but other than that they are senile and harmless. Utterly useless. They should probably be disposed of, but due to their unstable nature and sheer numbers most of them are stored all over the facility immobilized on simple cross-shaped structures to keep them from gathering into the Mangleds or becoming Panopticons.\n\nMangled - The biggest problem we have to deal with in the facility. A sick amalgamation of deformed cruxes forming a highly volatile and mobile tangle of wires and limbs driven by unstable Moai energy. Under no circumstances should it be allowed to get anywhere near power sources, it behaves akin to a leech and enters a destructive overdrive wreaking havoc and creating more Mangleds that spread like disease.\n\nCogbearer - One of the few potentially useful failures. Even a transplantation of a full god arm turned out to be a success. Exercises high innate strength. Often used for physical labor or, thanks to the cogs attached in place of the other arm - as a mobile replacement part for bigger machinery.\n\nCyclops - Due to yet unknown reasons, Cyclopses have most of their energy sink into the area of their frontal lobes. A simple set of focusing lens and a perforation in the cranium allow for utilizing them as an extremely inefficient and unstable welding laser. They lack both upper limbs and have a set of sawblades in place of their jaws. One could call them an overpriced box cutter. \n\nSpider - The only godling with a fully developed brain. Bizarrely enough, it lacks any other vital organs. A godling head with four artificial legs, a vision enhancing module and protracting sawblades. Used for surveillance or rarely, as memory banks and buffers.\n\nGuardian - A peculiar category of failures that appears to have intelligence but lack any organs that would contain it. They keep up this facade of comprehension fairly well, but upon closer examination it turns out that they merely imitate anything or anyone they encounter. Useful only as a security proxy. Appears to bear a worm-like organellum that requires further examination.\n\nPanopticon - Should the worm-like organellum stray away from a Guardian or manifest itself and take over a Crux - a Panopticon will be born. They appear to be capable of strategic thinking and manage other godlings in proximity. It is not clear what agenda drives their actions.
m.built_to_destroy_1a=LOG 12\/134\/68: \n\n68 Failures, 68 failed attempts at summoning Moaiximus into our realm. It seems like our vessels are too frail, most of them melt down or explode before the god manifests properly manifests itself. \n\nTheoretically, Moaiximus belongs to the weakest and youngest pantheon - the Pantheon of New, but despite that fusing even dozens of relics into the vessel bears no fruit, at this pace we are going to run out of them. \n\nIt turns out that the Moyai scribes were right, and the Golden Moyai is the only way to summon a proper god into our realm.
m.built_to_destroy_2a=LOG 12\/134\/69\: \n\nAt last, we have succeded! Aribalde\'s idea was genius, splitting the Golden Moyai infused vessel and the summoned ego in two allowed us to summon Moaiximus into our realm. The Golden One is conversing with them right now. \nWe are on the verge of a breakthrough in the holy war, we now have gods on our side.
